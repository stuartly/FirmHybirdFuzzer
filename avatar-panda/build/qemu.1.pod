SMP is supported with up to 255 CPUs.

QEMU uses the PC BIOS from the Seabios project and the Plex86/Bochs LGPL
VGA BIOS.

QEMU uses YM3812 emulation by Tatsuyuki Satoh.

QEMU uses GUS emulation (GUSEMU32 E<lt>B<http://www.deinmeister.de/gusemu/>E<gt>)
by Tibor "TS" Schütz.

Note that, by default, GUS shares IRQ(7) with parallel ports and so
QEMU must be told to not have parallel ports to have working GUS.

	
	qemu-system-i386 dos.img -soundhw gus -parallel none


Alternatively:
	
	qemu-system-i386 dos.img -device gus,irq=5


Or some other unclaimed IRQ.

CS4231A is the chip used in Windows Sound System and GUSMAX products


=head1 OPTIONS

I<disk_image> is a raw hard disk image for IDE hard disk 0. Some

=head3 Standard options


=over 4


=item B<-h>

Display help and exit

=item B<-version>

Display version information and exit

=item B<-machine [type=]>I<name>B<[,prop=>I<value>B<[,...]]>

Select the emulated machine by I<name>. Use C<-machine help> to list
available machines. Supported machine properties are:

=over 4


=item B<accel=>I<accels1>B<[:>I<accels2>B<[:...]]>

This is used to enable an accelerator. Depending on the target architecture,
kvm, xen, or tcg can be available. By default, tcg is used. If there is more
than one accelerator specified, the next one is used if the previous one fails
to initialize.

=item B<kernel_irqchip=on|off>

Controls in-kernel irqchip support for the chosen accelerator when available.

=item B<gfx_passthru=on|off>

Enables IGD GFX passthrough support for the chosen machine when available.

=item B<vmport=on|off|auto>

Enables emulation of VMWare IO port, for vmmouse etc. auto says to select the
value based on accel. For accel=xen the default is off otherwise the default
is on.

=item B<kvm_shadow_mem=size>

Defines the size of the KVM shadow MMU.

=item B<dump-guest-core=on|off>

Include guest memory in a core dump. The default is on.

=item B<mem-merge=on|off>

Enables or disables memory merge support. This feature, when supported by
the host, de-duplicates identical memory pages among VMs instances
(enabled by default).

=item B<aes-key-wrap=on|off>

Enables or disables AES key wrapping support on s390-ccw hosts. This feature
controls whether AES wrapping keys will be created to allow
execution of AES cryptographic functions.  The default is on.

=item B<dea-key-wrap=on|off>

Enables or disables DEA key wrapping support on s390-ccw hosts. This feature
controls whether DEA wrapping keys will be created to allow
execution of DEA cryptographic functions.  The default is on.

=item B<nvdimm=on|off>

Enables or disables NVDIMM support. The default is off.

=back


=item B<-cpu> I<model>

Select CPU model (C<-cpu help> for list and additional feature selection)

=item B<-accel> I<name>B<[,prop=>I<value>B<[,...]]>

This is used to enable an accelerator. Depending on the target architecture,
kvm, xen, or tcg can be available. By default, tcg is used. If there is more
than one accelerator specified, the next one is used if the previous one fails
to initialize.

=over 4


=item B<thread=single|multi>

Controls number of TCG threads. When the TCG is multi-threaded there will be one
thread per vCPU therefor taking advantage of additional host cores. The default
is to enable multi-threading where both the back-end and front-ends support it and
no incompatible TCG features have been enabled (e.g. icount/replay).

=back


=item B<-smp [cpus=]>I<n>B<[,cores=>I<cores>B<][,threads=>I<threads>B<][,sockets=>I<sockets>B<][,maxcpus=>I<maxcpus>B<]>

Simulate an SMP system with I<n> CPUs. On the PC target, up to 255
CPUs are supported. On Sparc32 target, Linux limits the number of usable CPUs
to 4.
For the PC target, the number of I<cores> per socket, the number
of I<threads> per cores and the total number of I<sockets> can be
specified. Missing values will be computed. If any on the three values is
given, the total number of CPUs I<n> can be omitted. I<maxcpus>
specifies the maximum number of hotpluggable CPUs.

=item B<-numa node[,mem=>I<size>B<][,cpus=>I<firstcpu>B<[->I<lastcpu>B<]][,nodeid=>I<node>B<]>


=item B<-numa node[,memdev=>I<id>B<][,cpus=>I<firstcpu>B<[->I<lastcpu>B<]][,nodeid=>I<node>B<]>

Simulate a multi node NUMA system. If B<mem>, B<memdev>
and B<cpus> are omitted, resources are split equally. Also, note
that the -B<numa> option doesn't allocate any of the specified
resources. That is, it just assigns existing resources to NUMA nodes. This
means that one still has to use the B<-m>, B<-smp> options
to allocate RAM and VCPUs respectively, and possibly B<-object>
to specify the memory backend for the B<memdev> suboption.

B<mem> and B<memdev> are mutually exclusive.  Furthermore, if one
node uses B<memdev>, all of them have to use it.

=item B<-add-fd fd=>I<fd>B<,set=>I<set>B<[,opaque=>I<opaque>B<]>


Add a file descriptor to an fd set.  Valid options are:


=over 4


=item B<fd=>I<fd>

This option defines the file descriptor of which a duplicate is added to fd set.
The file descriptor cannot be stdin, stdout, or stderr.

=item B<set=>I<set>

This option defines the ID of the fd set to add the file descriptor to.

=item B<opaque=>I<opaque>

This option defines a free-form string that can be used to describe I<fd>.

=back


You can open an image using pre-opened file descriptors from an fd set:
	
	qemu-system-i386
	-add-fd fd=3,set=2,opaque="rdwr:/path/to/file"
	-add-fd fd=4,set=2,opaque="rdonly:/path/to/file"
	-drive file=/dev/fdset/2,index=0,media=disk


=item B<-set> I<group>B<.>I<id>B<.>I<arg>B<=>I<value>

Set parameter I<arg> for item I<id> of type I<group>

=item B<-global> I<driver>B<.>I<prop>B<=>I<value>


=item B<-global driver=>I<driver>B<,property=>I<property>B<,value=>I<value>

Set default value of I<driver>'s property I<prop> to I<value>, e.g.:

	
	qemu-system-i386 -global ide-drive.physical_block_size=4096 -drive file=file,if=ide,index=0,media=disk


In particular, you can use this to set driver properties for devices which are 
created automatically by the machine model. To create a device which is not 
created automatically and set properties on it, use -B<device>.

-global I<driver>.I<prop>=I<value> is shorthand for -global
driver=I<driver>,property=I<prop>,value=I<value>.  The
longhand syntax works even when I<driver> contains a dot.

=item B<-boot [order=>I<drives>B<][,once=>I<drives>B<][,menu=on|off][,splash=>I<sp_name>B<][,splash-time=>I<sp_time>B<][,reboot-timeout=>I<rb_timeout>B<][,strict=on|off]>

Specify boot order I<drives> as a string of drive letters. Valid
drive letters depend on the target architecture. The x86 PC uses: a, b
(floppy 1 and 2), c (first hard disk), d (first CD-ROM), n-p (Etherboot
from network adapter 1-4), hard disk boot is the default. To apply a
particular boot order only on the first startup, specify it via
B<once>.

Interactive boot menus/prompts can be enabled via B<menu=on> as far
as firmware/BIOS supports them. The default is non-interactive boot.

A splash picture could be passed to bios, enabling user to show it as logo,
when option splash=I<sp_name> is given and menu=on, If firmware/BIOS
supports them. Currently Seabios for X86 system support it.
limitation: The splash file could be a jpeg file or a BMP file in 24 BPP
format(true color). The resolution should be supported by the SVGA mode, so
the recommended is 320x240, 640x480, 800x640.

A timeout could be passed to bios, guest will pause for I<rb_timeout> ms
when boot failed, then reboot. If I<rb_timeout> is '-1', guest will not
reboot, qemu passes '-1' to bios by default. Currently Seabios for X86
system support it.

Do strict boot via B<strict=on> as far as firmware/BIOS
supports it. This only effects when boot priority is changed by
bootindex options. The default is non-strict boot.

	
	# try to boot from network first, then from hard disk
	qemu-system-i386 -boot order=nc
	# boot from CD-ROM first, switch back to default order after reboot
	qemu-system-i386 -boot once=d
	# boot with a splash picture for 5 seconds.
	qemu-system-i386 -boot menu=on,splash=/root/boot.bmp,splash-time=5000


Note: The legacy format '-boot I<drives>' is still supported but its
use is discouraged as it may be removed from future versions.

=item B<-m [size=]>I<megs>B<[,slots=n,maxmem=size]>

Sets guest startup RAM size to I<megs> megabytes. Default is 128 MiB.
Optionally, a suffix of "M" or "G" can be used to signify a value in
megabytes or gigabytes respectively. Optional pair I<slots>, I<maxmem>
could be used to set amount of hotpluggable memory slots and maximum amount of
memory. Note that I<maxmem> must be aligned to the page size.

For example, the following command-line sets the guest startup RAM size to
1GB, creates 3 slots to hotplug additional memory and sets the maximum
memory the guest can reach to 4GB:

	
	qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1G,slots=3,maxmem=4G


If I<slots> and I<maxmem> are not specified, memory hotplug won't
be enabled and the guest startup RAM will never increase.

=item B<-mem-path> I<path>

Allocate guest RAM from a temporarily created file in I<path>.

=item B<-mem-prealloc>

Preallocate memory when using -mem-path.

=item B<-k> I<language>

Use keyboard layout I<language> (for example C<fr> for
French). This option is only needed where it is not easy to get raw PC
keycodes (e.g. on Macs, with some X11 servers or with a VNC or curses
display). You don't normally need to use it on PC/Linux or PC/Windows
hosts.

The available layouts are:
	
	ar  de-ch  es  fo     fr-ca  hu  ja  mk     no  pt-br  sv
	da  en-gb  et  fr     fr-ch  is  lt  nl     pl  ru     th
	de  en-us  fi  fr-be  hr     it  lv  nl-be  pt  sl     tr


The default is C<en-us>.

=item B<-audio-help>

Will show the audio subsystem help: list of drivers, tunable
parameters.

=item B<-soundhw> I<card1>B<[,>I<card2>B<,...] or -soundhw all>

Enable audio and selected sound hardware. Use 'help' to print all
available sound hardware.

	
	qemu-system-i386 -soundhw sb16,adlib disk.img
	qemu-system-i386 -soundhw es1370 disk.img
	qemu-system-i386 -soundhw ac97 disk.img
	qemu-system-i386 -soundhw hda disk.img
	qemu-system-i386 -soundhw all disk.img
	qemu-system-i386 -soundhw help


Note that Linux's i810_audio OSS kernel (for AC97) module might
require manually specifying clocking.

	
	modprobe i810_audio clocking=48000


=item B<-balloon none>

Disable balloon device.

=item B<-balloon virtio[,addr=>I<addr>B<]>

Enable virtio balloon device (default), optionally with PCI address
I<addr>.

=item B<-device> I<driver>B<[,>I<prop>B<[=>I<value>B<][,...]]>

Add device I<driver>.  I<prop>=I<value> sets driver
properties.  Valid properties depend on the driver.  To get help on
possible drivers and properties, use C<-device help> and
C<-device I<driver>,help>.

Some drivers are:

=item B<-device ipmi-bmc-sim,id=>I<id>B<[,slave_addr=>I<val>B<]>


Add an IPMI BMC.  This is a simulation of a hardware management
interface processor that normally sits on a system.  It provides
a watchdog and the ability to reset and power control the system.
You need to connect this to an IPMI interface to make it useful

The IPMI slave address to use for the BMC.  The default is 0x20.
This address is the BMC's address on the I2C network of management
controllers.  If you don't know what this means, it is safe to ignore
it.


=item B<-device ipmi-bmc-extern,id=>I<id>B<,chardev=>I<id>B<[,slave_addr=>I<val>B<]>


Add a connection to an external IPMI BMC simulator.  Instead of
locally emulating the BMC like the above item, instead connect
to an external entity that provides the IPMI services.

A connection is made to an external BMC simulator.  If you do this, it
is strongly recommended that you use the "reconnect=" chardev option
to reconnect to the simulator if the connection is lost.  Note that if
this is not used carefully, it can be a security issue, as the
interface has the ability to send resets, NMIs, and power off the VM.
It's best if QEMU makes a connection to an external simulator running
on a secure port on localhost, so neither the simulator nor QEMU is
exposed to any outside network.

See the "lanserv/README.vm" file in the OpenIPMI library for more
details on the external interface.


=item B<-device isa-ipmi-kcs,bmc=>I<id>B<[,ioport=>I<val>B<][,irq=>I<val>B<]>


Add a KCS IPMI interafce on the ISA bus.  This also adds a
corresponding ACPI and SMBIOS entries, if appropriate.


=over 4


=item B<bmc=>I<id>

The BMC to connect to, one of ipmi-bmc-sim or ipmi-bmc-extern above.

=item B<ioport=>I<val>

Define the I/O address of the interface.  The default is 0xca0 for KCS.

=item B<irq=>I<val>

Define the interrupt to use.  The default is 5.  To disable interrupts,
set this to 0.

=back



=item B<-device isa-ipmi-bt,bmc=>I<id>B<[,ioport=>I<val>B<][,irq=>I<val>B<]>


Like the KCS interface, but defines a BT interface.  The default port is
0xe4 and the default interrupt is 5.


=item B<-name> I<name>

Sets the I<name> of the guest.
This name will be displayed in the SDL window caption.
The I<name> will also be used for the VNC server.
Also optionally set the top visible process name in Linux.
Naming of individual threads can also be enabled on Linux to aid debugging.

=item B<-uuid> I<uuid>

Set system UUID.

=back


=head3 Block device options


=over 4


=item B<-fda> I<file>


=item B<-fdb> I<file>

=item B<-hda> I<file>


=item B<-hdb> I<file>


=item B<-hdc> I<file>


=item B<-hdd> I<file>

Use I<file> as hard disk 0, 1, 2 or 3 image.

=item B<-cdrom> I<file>

Use I<file> as CD-ROM image (you cannot use B<-hdc> and
B<-cdrom> at the same time). You can use the host CD-ROM by
using F</dev/cdrom> as filename.

=item B<-drive> I<option>B<[,>I<option>B<[,>I<option>B<[,...]]]>


Define a new drive. Valid options are:


=over 4


=item B<file=>I<file>

This option defines which disk image to use with
this drive. If the filename contains comma, you must double it
(for instance, "file=my,,file" to use file "my,file").

Special files such as iSCSI devices can be specified using protocol
specific URLs. See the section for "Device URL Syntax" for more information.

=item B<if=>I<interface>

This option defines on which type on interface the drive is connected.
Available types are: ide, scsi, sd, mtd, floppy, pflash, virtio.

=item B<bus=>I<bus>B<,unit=>I<unit>

These options define where is connected the drive by defining the bus number and
the unit id.

=item B<index=>I<index>

This option defines where is connected the drive by using an index in the list
of available connectors of a given interface type.

=item B<media=>I<media>

This option defines the type of the media: disk or cdrom.

=item B<cyls=>I<c>B<,heads=>I<h>B<,secs=>I<s>B<[,trans=>I<t>B<]>

These options have the same definition as they have in B<-hdachs>.

=item B<snapshot=>I<snapshot>

I<snapshot> is "on" or "off" and controls snapshot mode for the given drive
(see B<-snapshot>).

=item B<cache=>I<cache>

I<cache> is "none", "writeback", "unsafe", "directsync" or "writethrough" and controls how the host cache is used to access block data.

=item B<aio=>I<aio>

I<aio> is "threads", or "native" and selects between pthread based disk I/O and native Linux AIO.

=item B<discard=>I<discard>

I<discard> is one of "ignore" (or "off") or "unmap" (or "on") and controls whether I<discard> (also known as I<trim> or I<unmap>) requests are ignored or passed to the filesystem.  Some machine types may not support discard requests.

=item B<format=>I<format>

Specify which disk I<format> will be used rather than detecting
the format.  Can be used to specify format=raw to avoid interpreting
an untrusted format header.

=item B<serial=>I<serial>

This option specifies the serial number to assign to the device.

=item B<addr=>I<addr>

Specify the controller's PCI address (if=virtio only).

=item B<werror=>I<action>B<,rerror=>I<action>

Specify which I<action> to take on write and read errors. Valid actions are:
"ignore" (ignore the error and try to continue), "stop" (pause QEMU),
"report" (report the error to the guest), "enospc" (pause QEMU only if the
host disk is full; report the error to the guest otherwise).
The default setting is B<werror=enospc> and B<rerror=report>.

=item B<readonly>

Open drive B<file> as read-only. Guest write attempts will fail.

=item B<copy-on-read=>I<copy-on-read>

I<copy-on-read> is "on" or "off" and enables whether to copy read backing
file sectors into the image file.

=item B<detect-zeroes=>I<detect-zeroes>

I<detect-zeroes> is "off", "on" or "unmap" and enables the automatic
conversion of plain zero writes by the OS to driver specific optimized
zero write commands. You may even choose "unmap" if I<discard> is set
to "unmap" to allow a zero write to be converted to an UNMAP operation.

=back


By default, the B<cache=writeback> mode is used. It will report data
writes as completed as soon as the data is present in the host page cache.
This is safe as long as your guest OS makes sure to correctly flush disk caches
where needed. If your guest OS does not handle volatile disk write caches
correctly and your host crashes or loses power, then the guest may experience
data corruption.

For such guests, you should consider using B<cache=writethrough>. This
means that the host page cache will be used to read and write data, but write
notification will be sent to the guest only after QEMU has made sure to flush
each write to the disk. Be aware that this has a major impact on performance.

The host page cache can be avoided entirely with B<cache=none>.  This will
attempt to do disk IO directly to the guest's memory.  QEMU may still perform
an internal copy of the data. Note that this is considered a writeback mode and
the guest OS must handle the disk write cache correctly in order to avoid data
corruption on host crashes.

The host page cache can be avoided while only sending write notifications to
the guest when the data has been flushed to the disk using
B<cache=directsync>.

In case you don't care about data integrity over host failures, use
B<cache=unsafe>. This option tells QEMU that it never needs to write any
data to the disk but can instead keep things in cache. If anything goes wrong,
like your host losing power, the disk storage getting disconnected accidentally,
etc. your image will most probably be rendered unusable.   When using
the B<-snapshot> option, unsafe caching is always used.

Copy-on-read avoids accessing the same backing file sectors repeatedly and is
useful when the backing file is over a slow network.  By default copy-on-read
is off.

Instead of B<-cdrom> you can use:
	
	qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=2,media=cdrom


Instead of B<-hda>, B<-hdb>, B<-hdc>, B<-hdd>, you can
use:
	
	qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=0,media=disk
	qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=1,media=disk
	qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=2,media=disk
	qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=3,media=disk


You can open an image using pre-opened file descriptors from an fd set:
	
	qemu-system-i386
	-add-fd fd=3,set=2,opaque="rdwr:/path/to/file"
	-add-fd fd=4,set=2,opaque="rdonly:/path/to/file"
	-drive file=/dev/fdset/2,index=0,media=disk


You can connect a CDROM to the slave of ide0:
	
	qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,if=ide,index=1,media=cdrom


If you don't specify the "file=" argument, you define an empty drive:
	
	qemu-system-i386 -drive if=ide,index=1,media=cdrom


Instead of B<-fda>, B<-fdb>, you can use:
	
	qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=0,if=floppy
	qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=1,if=floppy


By default, I<interface> is "ide" and I<index> is automatically
incremented:
	
	qemu-system-i386 -drive file=a -drive file=b"

is interpreted like:
	
	qemu-system-i386 -hda a -hdb b


=item B<-mtdblock> I<file>

Use I<file> as on-board Flash memory image.

=item B<-sd> I<file>

Use I<file> as SecureDigital card image.

=item B<-pflash> I<file>

Use I<file> as a parallel flash image.

=item B<-snapshot>

Write to temporary files instead of disk image files. In this case,
the raw disk image you use is not written back. You can however force
the write back by pressing B<C-a s>.

=item B<-hdachs> I<c>B<,>I<h>B<,>I<s>B<,[,>I<t>B<]>

Force hard disk 0 physical geometry (1 E<lt>= I<c> E<lt>= 16383, 1 E<lt>=
I<h> E<lt>= 16, 1 E<lt>= I<s> E<lt>= 63) and optionally force the BIOS
translation mode (I<t>=none, lba or auto). Usually QEMU can guess
all those parameters. This option is useful for old MS-DOS disk
images.


=item B<-fsdev> I<fsdriver>B<,id=>I<id>B<,path=>I<path>B<,[security_model=>I<security_model>B<][,writeout=>I<writeout>B<][,readonly][,socket=>I<socket>B<|sock_fd=>I<sock_fd>B<]>

Define a new file system device. Valid options are:

=over 4


=item I<fsdriver>

This option specifies the fs driver backend to use.
Currently "local", "handle" and "proxy" file system drivers are supported.

=item B<id=>I<id>

Specifies identifier for this device

=item B<path=>I<path>

Specifies the export path for the file system device. Files under
this path will be available to the 9p client on the guest.

=item B<security_model=>I<security_model>

Specifies the security model to be used for this export path.
Supported security models are "passthrough", "mapped-xattr", "mapped-file" and "none".
In "passthrough" security model, files are stored using the same
credentials as they are created on the guest. This requires QEMU
to run as root. In "mapped-xattr" security model, some of the file
attributes like uid, gid, mode bits and link target are stored as
file attributes. For "mapped-file" these attributes are stored in the
hidden .virtfs_metadata directory. Directories exported by this security model cannot
interact with other unix tools. "none" security model is same as
passthrough except the sever won't report failures if it fails to
set file attributes like ownership. Security model is mandatory
only for local fsdriver. Other fsdrivers (like handle, proxy) don't take
security model as a parameter.

=item B<writeout=>I<writeout>

This is an optional argument. The only supported value is "immediate".
This means that host page cache will be used to read and write data but
write notification will be sent to the guest only when the data has been
reported as written by the storage subsystem.

=item B<readonly>

Enables exporting 9p share as a readonly mount for guests. By default
read-write access is given.

=item B<socket=>I<socket>

Enables proxy filesystem driver to use passed socket file for communicating
with virtfs-proxy-helper

=item B<sock_fd=>I<sock_fd>

Enables proxy filesystem driver to use passed socket descriptor for
communicating with virtfs-proxy-helper. Usually a helper like libvirt
will create socketpair and pass one of the fds as sock_fd

=back


-fsdev option is used along with -device driver "virtio-9p-pci".

=item B<-device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=>I<id>B<,mount_tag=>I<mount_tag>

Options for virtio-9p-pci driver are:

=over 4


=item B<fsdev=>I<id>

Specifies the id value specified along with -fsdev option

=item B<mount_tag=>I<mount_tag>

The general form of a Virtual File system pass-through options are:

=over 4


=item I<fsdriver>

This option specifies the fs driver backend to use.
Currently "local", "handle" and "proxy" file system drivers are supported.

=item B<id=>I<id>

Specifies identifier for this device

=item B<path=>I<path>

Specifies the export path for the file system device. Files under
this path will be available to the 9p client on the guest.

=item B<security_model=>I<security_model>

Specifies the security model to be used for this export path.
Supported security models are "passthrough", "mapped-xattr", "mapped-file" and "none".
In "passthrough" security model, files are stored using the same
credentials as they are created on the guest. This requires QEMU
to run as root. In "mapped-xattr" security model, some of the file
attributes like uid, gid, mode bits and link target are stored as
file attributes. For "mapped-file" these attributes are stored in the
hidden .virtfs_metadata directory. Directories exported by this security model cannot
interact with other unix tools. "none" security model is same as
passthrough except the sever won't report failures if it fails to
set file attributes like ownership. Security model is mandatory only
for local fsdriver. Other fsdrivers (like handle, proxy) don't take security
model as a parameter.

=item B<writeout=>I<writeout>

This is an optional argument. The only supported value is "immediate".
This means that host page cache will be used to read and write data but
write notification will be sent to the guest only when the data has been
reported as written by the storage subsystem.

=item B<readonly>

Enables exporting 9p share as a readonly mount for guests. By default
read-write access is given.

=item B<socket=>I<socket>

Enables proxy filesystem driver to use passed socket file for
communicating with virtfs-proxy-helper. Usually a helper like libvirt
will create socketpair and pass one of the fds as sock_fd

=item B<sock_fd>

Enables proxy filesystem driver to use passed 'sock_fd' as the socket
descriptor for interfacing with virtfs-proxy-helper

=back


=item B<-virtfs_synth>

Create synthetic file system image

=back


=head3 USB options


=over 4


=item B<-usb>

Enable the USB driver (will be the default soon)


=item B<-usbdevice> I<devname>

Add the USB device I<devname>. 


=over 4



=item B<mouse>

Virtual Mouse. This will override the PS/2 mouse emulation when activated.


=item B<tablet>

Pointer device that uses absolute coordinates (like a touchscreen). This
means QEMU is able to report the mouse position without having to grab the
mouse. Also overrides the PS/2 mouse emulation when activated.


=item B<disk:[format=>I<format>B<]:>I<file>

Mass storage device based on file. The optional I<format> argument
will be used rather than detecting the format. Can be used to specify
C<format=raw> to avoid interpreting an untrusted format header.


=item B<host:>I<bus>B<.>I<addr>

Pass through the host device identified by I<bus>.I<addr> (Linux only).


=item B<host:>I<vendor_id>B<:>I<product_id>

Pass through the host device identified by I<vendor_id>:I<product_id>
(Linux only).


=item B<serial:[vendorid=>I<vendor_id>B<][,productid=>I<product_id>B<]:>I<dev>

Serial converter to host character device I<dev>, see C<-serial> for the
available devices.


=item B<braille>

Braille device.  This will use BrlAPI to display the braille output on a real
or fake device.


=item B<net:>I<options>

Network adapter that supports CDC ethernet and RNDIS protocols.


=back


=back


=head3 Display options


=over 4


=item B<-display> I<type>

Select type of display to use. This option is a replacement for the
old style -sdl/-curses/... options. Valid values for I<type> are

=over 4


=item B<sdl>

Display video output via SDL (usually in a separate graphics
window; see the SDL documentation for other possibilities).

=item B<curses>

Display video output via curses. For graphics device models which
support a text mode, QEMU can display this output using a
curses/ncurses interface. Nothing is displayed when the graphics
device is in graphical mode or if the graphics device does not support
a text mode. Generally only the VGA device models support text mode.

=item B<none>

Do not display video output. The guest will still see an emulated
graphics card, but its output will not be displayed to the QEMU
user. This option differs from the -nographic option in that it
only affects what is done with video output; -nographic also changes
the destination of the serial and parallel port data.

=item B<gtk>

Display video output in a GTK window. This interface provides drop-down
menus and other UI elements to configure and control the VM during
runtime.

=item B<vnc>

Start a VNC server on display E<lt>argE<gt>

=back


=item B<-nographic>

Normally, if QEMU is compiled with graphical window support, it displays
output such as guest graphics, guest console, and the QEMU monitor in a
window. With this option, you can totally disable graphical output so
that QEMU is a simple command line application. The emulated serial port
is redirected on the console and muxed with the monitor (unless
redirected elsewhere explicitly). Therefore, you can still use QEMU to
debug a Linux kernel with a serial console. Use B<C-a h> for help on
switching between the console and monitor.

=item B<-curses>

Normally, if QEMU is compiled with graphical window support, it displays
output such as guest graphics, guest console, and the QEMU monitor in a
window. With this option, QEMU can display the VGA output when in text
mode using a curses/ncurses interface. Nothing is displayed in graphical
mode.

=item B<-no-frame>

Do not use decorations for SDL windows and start them using the whole
available screen space. This makes the using QEMU in a dedicated desktop
workspace more convenient.

=item B<-alt-grab>

Use Ctrl-Alt-Shift to grab mouse (instead of Ctrl-Alt). Note that this also
affects the special keys (for fullscreen, monitor-mode switching, etc).

=item B<-ctrl-grab>

Use Right-Ctrl to grab mouse (instead of Ctrl-Alt). Note that this also
affects the special keys (for fullscreen, monitor-mode switching, etc).

=item B<-no-quit>

Disable SDL window close capability.

=item B<-sdl>

Enable SDL.

=item B<-spice> I<option>B<[,>I<option>B<[,...]]>

Enable the spice remote desktop protocol. Valid options are


=over 4



=item B<port=E<lt>nrE<gt>>

Set the TCP port spice is listening on for plaintext channels.


=item B<addr=E<lt>addrE<gt>>

Set the IP address spice is listening on.  Default is any address.


=item B<ipv4>


=item B<ipv6>


=item B<unix>

Force using the specified IP version.


=item B<password=E<lt>secretE<gt>>

Set the password you need to authenticate.


=item B<sasl>

Require that the client use SASL to authenticate with the spice.
The exact choice of authentication method used is controlled from the
system / user's SASL configuration file for the 'qemu' service. This
is typically found in /etc/sasl2/qemu.conf. If running QEMU as an
unprivileged user, an environment variable SASL_CONF_PATH can be used
to make it search alternate locations for the service config.
While some SASL auth methods can also provide data encryption (eg GSSAPI),
it is recommended that SASL always be combined with the 'tls' and
'x509' settings to enable use of SSL and server certificates. This
ensures a data encryption preventing compromise of authentication
credentials.


=item B<disable-ticketing>

Allow client connects without authentication.


=item B<disable-copy-paste>

Disable copy paste between the client and the guest.


=item B<disable-agent-file-xfer>

Disable spice-vdagent based file-xfer between the client and the guest.


=item B<tls-port=E<lt>nrE<gt>>

Set the TCP port spice is listening on for encrypted channels.


=item B<x509-dir=E<lt>dirE<gt>>

Set the x509 file directory. Expects same filenames as -vnc $display,x509=$dir


=item B<x509-key-file=E<lt>fileE<gt>>


=item B<x509-key-password=E<lt>fileE<gt>>


=item B<x509-cert-file=E<lt>fileE<gt>>


=item B<x509-cacert-file=E<lt>fileE<gt>>


=item B<x509-dh-key-file=E<lt>fileE<gt>>

The x509 file names can also be configured individually.


=item B<tls-ciphers=E<lt>listE<gt>>

Specify which ciphers to use.


=item B<tls-channel=[main|display|cursor|inputs|record|playback]>


=item B<plaintext-channel=[main|display|cursor|inputs|record|playback]>

Force specific channel to be used with or without TLS encryption.  The
options can be specified multiple times to configure multiple
channels.  The special name "default" can be used to set the default
mode.  For channels which are not explicitly forced into one mode the
spice client is allowed to pick tls/plaintext as he pleases.


=item B<image-compression=[auto_glz|auto_lz|quic|glz|lz|off]>

Configure image compression (lossless).
Default is auto_glz.


=item B<jpeg-wan-compression=[auto|never|always]>


=item B<zlib-glz-wan-compression=[auto|never|always]>

Configure wan image compression (lossy for slow links).
Default is auto.


=item B<streaming-video=[off|all|filter]>

Configure video stream detection.  Default is off.


=item B<agent-mouse=[on|off]>

Enable/disable passing mouse events via vdagent.  Default is on.


=item B<playback-compression=[on|off]>

Enable/disable audio stream compression (using celt 0.5.1).  Default is on.


=item B<seamless-migration=[on|off]>

Enable/disable spice seamless migration. Default is off.


=item B<gl=[on|off]>

Enable/disable OpenGL context. Default is off.


=item B<rendernode=E<lt>fileE<gt>>

DRM render node for OpenGL rendering. If not specified, it will pick
the first available. (Since 2.9)


=back


=item B<-portrait>

Rotate graphical output 90 deg left (only PXA LCD).

=item B<-rotate> I<deg>

Rotate graphical output some deg left (only PXA LCD).

=item B<-vga> I<type>

Select type of VGA card to emulate. Valid values for I<type> are

=over 4


=item B<cirrus>

Cirrus Logic GD5446 Video card. All Windows versions starting from
Windows 95 should recognize and use this graphic card. For optimal
performances, use 16 bit color depth in the guest and the host OS.
(This card was the default before QEMU 2.2)

=item B<std>

Standard VGA card with Bochs VBE extensions.  If your guest OS
supports the VESA 2.0 VBE extensions (e.g. Windows XP) and if you want
to use high resolution modes (E<gt>= 1280x1024x16) then you should use
this option. (This card is the default since QEMU 2.2)

=item B<vmware>

VMWare SVGA-II compatible adapter. Use it if you have sufficiently
recent XFree86/XOrg server or Windows guest with a driver for this
card.

=item B<qxl>

QXL paravirtual graphic card.  It is VGA compatible (including VESA
2.0 VBE support).  Works best with qxl guest drivers installed though.
Recommended choice when using the spice protocol.

=item B<tcx>

(sun4m only) Sun TCX framebuffer. This is the default framebuffer for
sun4m machines and offers both 8-bit and 24-bit colour depths at a
fixed resolution of 1024x768.

=item B<cg3>

(sun4m only) Sun cgthree framebuffer. This is a simple 8-bit framebuffer
for sun4m machines available in both 1024x768 (OpenBIOS) and 1152x900 (OBP)
resolutions aimed at people wishing to run older Solaris versions.

=item B<virtio>

Virtio VGA card.

=item B<none>

Disable VGA card.

=back


=item B<-full-screen>

Start in full screen.

=item B<-g> I<width>B<x>I<height>B<[x>I<depth>B<]>

Set the initial graphical resolution and depth (PPC, SPARC only).

=item B<-vnc> I<display>B<[,>I<option>B<[,>I<option>B<[,...]]]>

Normally, if QEMU is compiled with graphical window support, it displays
output such as guest graphics, guest console, and the QEMU monitor in a
window. With this option, you can have QEMU listen on VNC display
I<display> and redirect the VGA display over the VNC session. It is
very useful to enable the usb tablet device when using this option
(option B<-usbdevice tablet>). When using the VNC display, you
must use the B<-k> parameter to set the keyboard layout if you are
not using en-us. Valid syntax for the I<display> is


=over 4



=item B<to=>I<L>


With this option, QEMU will try next available VNC I<display>s, until the
number I<L>, if the origianlly defined "-vnc I<display>" is not
available, e.g. port 5900+I<display> is already used by another
application. By default, to=0.


=item I<host>B<:>I<d>


TCP connections will only be allowed from I<host> on display I<d>.
By convention the TCP port is 5900+I<d>. Optionally, I<host> can
be omitted in which case the server will accept connections from any host.


=item B<unix:>I<path>


Connections will be allowed over UNIX domain sockets where I<path> is the
location of a unix socket to listen for connections on.


=item B<none>


VNC is initialized but not started. The monitor C<change> command
can be used to later start the VNC server.


=back


Following the I<display> value there may be one or more I<option> flags
separated by commas. Valid options are


=over 4



=item B<reverse>


Connect to a listening VNC client via a "reverse" connection. The
client is specified by the I<display>. For reverse network
connections (I<host>:I<d>,C<reverse>), the I<d> argument
is a TCP port number, not a display number.


=item B<websocket>


Opens an additional TCP listening port dedicated to VNC Websocket connections.
If a bare I<websocket> option is given, the Websocket port is
5700+I<display>. An alternative port can be specified with the
syntax C<websocket>=I<port>.

If I<host> is specified connections will only be allowed from this host.
It is possible to control the websocket listen address independently, using
the syntax C<websocket>=I<host>:I<port>.

If no TLS credentials are provided, the websocket connection runs in
unencrypted mode. If TLS credentials are provided, the websocket connection
requires encrypted client connections.


=item B<password>


Require that password based authentication is used for client connections.

The password must be set separately using the C<set_password> command in
the B<pcsys_monitor>. The syntax to change your password is:
C<set_password E<lt>protocolE<gt> E<lt>passwordE<gt>> where E<lt>protocolE<gt> could be either
"vnc" or "spice".

If you would like to change E<lt>protocolE<gt> password expiration, you should use
C<expire_password E<lt>protocolE<gt> E<lt>expiration-timeE<gt>> where expiration time could
be one of the following options: now, never, +seconds or UNIX time of
expiration, e.g. +60 to make password expire in 60 seconds, or 1335196800
to make password expire on "Mon Apr 23 12:00:00 EDT 2012" (UNIX time for this
date and time).

You can also use keywords "now" or "never" for the expiration time to
allow E<lt>protocolE<gt> password to expire immediately or never expire.


=item B<tls-creds=>I<ID>


Provides the ID of a set of TLS credentials to use to secure the
VNC server. They will apply to both the normal VNC server socket
and the websocket socket (if enabled). Setting TLS credentials
will cause the VNC server socket to enable the VeNCrypt auth
mechanism.  The credentials should have been previously created
using the B<-object tls-creds> argument.

The B<tls-creds> parameter obsoletes the B<tls>,
B<x509>, and B<x509verify> options, and as such
it is not permitted to set both new and old type options at
the same time.


=item B<tls>


Require that client use TLS when communicating with the VNC server. This
uses anonymous TLS credentials so is susceptible to a man-in-the-middle
attack. It is recommended that this option be combined with either the
B<x509> or B<x509verify> options.

This option is now deprecated in favor of using the B<tls-creds>
argument.


=item B<x509=>I</path/to/certificate/dir>


Valid if B<tls> is specified. Require that x509 credentials are used
for negotiating the TLS session. The server will send its x509 certificate
to the client. It is recommended that a password be set on the VNC server
to provide authentication of the client when this is used. The path following
this option specifies where the x509 certificates are to be loaded from.
See the B<vnc_security> section for details on generating certificates.

This option is now deprecated in favour of using the B<tls-creds>
argument.


=item B<x509verify=>I</path/to/certificate/dir>


Valid if B<tls> is specified. Require that x509 credentials are used
for negotiating the TLS session. The server will send its x509 certificate
to the client, and request that the client send its own x509 certificate.
The server will validate the client's certificate against the CA certificate,
and reject clients when validation fails. If the certificate authority is
trusted, this is a sufficient authentication mechanism. You may still wish
to set a password on the VNC server as a second authentication layer. The
path following this option specifies where the x509 certificates are to
be loaded from. See the B<vnc_security> section for details on generating
certificates.

This option is now deprecated in favour of using the B<tls-creds>
argument.


=item B<sasl>


Require that the client use SASL to authenticate with the VNC server.
The exact choice of authentication method used is controlled from the
system / user's SASL configuration file for the 'qemu' service. This
is typically found in /etc/sasl2/qemu.conf. If running QEMU as an
unprivileged user, an environment variable SASL_CONF_PATH can be used
to make it search alternate locations for the service config.
While some SASL auth methods can also provide data encryption (eg GSSAPI),
it is recommended that SASL always be combined with the 'tls' and
'x509' settings to enable use of SSL and server certificates. This
ensures a data encryption preventing compromise of authentication
credentials. See the B<vnc_security> section for details on using
SASL authentication.


=item B<acl>


Turn on access control lists for checking of the x509 client certificate
and SASL party. For x509 certs, the ACL check is made against the
certificate's distinguished name. This is something that looks like
C<C=GB,O=ACME,L=Boston,CN=bob>. For SASL party, the ACL check is
made against the username, which depending on the SASL plugin, may
include a realm component, eg C<bob> or C<bob@EXAMPLE.COM>.
When the B<acl> flag is set, the initial access list will be
empty, with a C<deny> policy. Thus no one will be allowed to
use the VNC server until the ACLs have been loaded. This can be
achieved using the C<acl> monitor command.


=item B<lossy>


Enable lossy compression methods (gradient, JPEG, ...). If this
option is set, VNC client may receive lossy framebuffer updates
depending on its encoding settings. Enabling this option can save
a lot of bandwidth at the expense of quality.


=item B<non-adaptive>


Disable adaptive encodings. Adaptive encodings are enabled by default.
An adaptive encoding will try to detect frequently updated screen regions,
and send updates in these regions using a lossy encoding (like JPEG).
This can be really helpful to save bandwidth when playing videos. Disabling
adaptive encodings restores the original static behavior of encodings
like Tight.


=item B<share=[allow-exclusive|force-shared|ignore]>


Set display sharing policy.  'allow-exclusive' allows clients to ask
for exclusive access.  As suggested by the rfb spec this is
implemented by dropping other connections.  Connecting multiple
clients in parallel requires all clients asking for a shared session
(vncviewer: -shared switch).  This is the default.  'force-shared'
disables exclusive client access.  Useful for shared desktop sessions,
where you don't want someone forgetting specify -shared disconnect
everybody else.  'ignore' completely ignores the shared flag and
allows everybody connect unconditionally.  Doesn't conform to the rfb
spec but is traditional QEMU behavior.


=item B<key-delay-ms>


Set keyboard delay, for key down and key up events, in milliseconds.
Default is 1.  Keyboards are low-bandwidth devices, so this slowdown
can help the device and guest to keep up and not lose events in case
events are arriving in bulk.  Possible causes for the latter are flaky
network connections, or scripts for automated testing.

=item B<-win2k-hack>

Use it when installing Windows 2000 to avoid a disk full bug. After
Windows 2000 is installed, you no longer need this option (this option
slows down the IDE transfers).

=item B<-no-fd-bootchk>

Disable boot signature checking for floppy disks in BIOS. May
be needed to boot from old floppy disks.

=item B<-no-acpi>

Disable ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) support. Use
it if your guest OS complains about ACPI problems (PC target machine
only).

=item B<-no-hpet>

Disable HPET support.

=item B<-acpitable [sig=>I<str>B<][,rev=>I<n>B<][,oem_id=>I<str>B<][,oem_table_id=>I<str>B<][,oem_rev=>I<n>B<] [,asl_compiler_id=>I<str>B<][,asl_compiler_rev=>I<n>B<][,data=>I<file1>B<[:>I<file2>B<]...]>

Add ACPI table with specified header fields and context from specified files.
For file=, take whole ACPI table from the specified files, including all
ACPI headers (possible overridden by other options).
For data=, only data
portion of the table is used, all header information is specified in the
command line.
If a SLIC table is supplied to QEMU, then the SLIC's oem_id and oem_table_id
fields will override the same in the RSDT and the FADT (a.k.a. FACP), in order
to ensure the field matches required by the Microsoft SLIC spec and the ACPI
spec.

=item B<-smbios file=>I<binary>

Load SMBIOS entry from binary file.

Create a new Network Interface Card and connect it to VLAN I<n> (I<n>
= 0 is the default). The NIC is an e1000 by default on the PC
target. Optionally, the MAC address can be changed to I<mac>, the
device address set to I<addr> (PCI cards only),
and a I<name> can be assigned for use in monitor commands.
Optionally, for PCI cards, you can specify the number I<v> of MSI-X vectors
that the card should have; this option currently only affects virtio cards; set
I<v> = 0 to disable MSI-X. If no B<-net> option is specified, a single
NIC is created.  QEMU can emulate several different models of network card.
Valid values for I<type> are
C<virtio>, C<i82551>, C<i82557b>, C<i82559er>,
C<ne2k_pci>, C<ne2k_isa>, C<pcnet>, C<rtl8139>,
C<e1000>, C<smc91c111>, C<lance> and C<mcf_fec>.

Use the user mode network stack which requires no administrator
privilege to run. Valid options are:


=over 4


=item B<vlan=>I<n>

Connect user mode stack to VLAN I<n> (I<n> = 0 is the default).


=item B<id=>I<id>


=item B<name=>I<name>

Assign symbolic name for use in monitor commands.

B<ipv4> and B<ipv6> specify that either IPv4 or IPv6 must
be enabled.  If neither is specified both protocols are enabled.


=item B<net=>I<addr>B<[/>I<mask>B<]>

Set IP network address the guest will see. Optionally specify the netmask,
either in the form a.b.c.d or as number of valid top-most bits. Default is
10.0.2.0/24.


=item B<host=>I<addr>

Specify the guest-visible address of the host. Default is the 2nd IP in the
guest network, i.e. x.x.x.2.


=item B<ipv6-net=>I<addr>B<[/>I<int>B<]>

Set IPv6 network address the guest will see (default is fec0::/64). The
network prefix is given in the usual hexadecimal IPv6 address
notation. The prefix size is optional, and is given as the number of
valid top-most bits (default is 64).


=item B<ipv6-host=>I<addr>

Specify the guest-visible IPv6 address of the host. Default is the 2nd IPv6 in
the guest network, i.e. xxxx::2.


=item B<restrict=on|off>

If this option is enabled, the guest will be isolated, i.e. it will not be
able to contact the host and no guest IP packets will be routed over the host
to the outside. This option does not affect any explicitly set forwarding rules.


=item B<hostname=>I<name>

Specifies the client hostname reported by the built-in DHCP server.


=item B<dhcpstart=>I<addr>

Specify the first of the 16 IPs the built-in DHCP server can assign. Default
is the 15th to 31st IP in the guest network, i.e. x.x.x.15 to x.x.x.31.


=item B<dns=>I<addr>

Specify the guest-visible address of the virtual nameserver. The address must
be different from the host address. Default is the 3rd IP in the guest network,
i.e. x.x.x.3.


=item B<ipv6-dns=>I<addr>

Specify the guest-visible address of the IPv6 virtual nameserver. The address
must be different from the host address. Default is the 3rd IP in the guest
network, i.e. xxxx::3.


=item B<dnssearch=>I<domain>

Provides an entry for the domain-search list sent by the built-in
DHCP server. More than one domain suffix can be transmitted by specifying
this option multiple times. If supported, this will cause the guest to
automatically try to append the given domain suffix(es) in case a domain name
can not be resolved.

Example:
	
	qemu -net user,dnssearch=mgmt.example.org,dnssearch=example.org [...]



=item B<tftp=>I<dir>

When using the user mode network stack, activate a built-in TFTP
server. The files in I<dir> will be exposed as the root of a TFTP server.
The TFTP client on the guest must be configured in binary mode (use the command
C<bin> of the Unix TFTP client).


=item B<bootfile=>I<file>

When using the user mode network stack, broadcast I<file> as the BOOTP
filename. In conjunction with B<tftp>, this can be used to network boot
a guest from a local directory.

Example (using pxelinux):
	
	qemu-system-i386 -hda linux.img -boot n -net user,tftp=/path/to/tftp/files,bootfile=/pxelinux.0



=item B<smb=>I<dir>B<[,smbserver=>I<addr>B<]>

When using the user mode network stack, activate a built-in SMB
server so that Windows OSes can access to the host files in F<I<dir>>
transparently. The IP address of the SMB server can be set to I<addr>. By
default the 4th IP in the guest network is used, i.e. x.x.x.4.

In the guest Windows OS, the line:
	
	10.0.2.4 smbserver

must be added in the file F<C:\WINDOWS\LMHOSTS> (for windows 9x/Me)
or F<C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC\LMHOSTS> (Windows NT/2000).

Then F<I<dir>> can be accessed in F<\\smbserver\qemu>.

Note that a SAMBA server must be installed on the host OS.
QEMU was tested successfully with smbd versions from Red Hat 9,
Fedora Core 3 and OpenSUSE 11.x.


=item B<hostfwd=[tcp|udp]:[>I<hostaddr>B<]:>I<hostport>B<-[>I<guestaddr>B<]:>I<guestport>

Redirect incoming TCP or UDP connections to the host port I<hostport> to
the guest IP address I<guestaddr> on guest port I<guestport>. If
I<guestaddr> is not specified, its value is x.x.x.15 (default first address
given by the built-in DHCP server). By specifying I<hostaddr>, the rule can
be bound to a specific host interface. If no connection type is set, TCP is
used. This option can be given multiple times.

For example, to redirect host X11 connection from screen 1 to guest
screen 0, use the following:

	
	# on the host
	qemu-system-i386 -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:6001-:6000 [...]
	# this host xterm should open in the guest X11 server
	xterm -display :1


To redirect telnet connections from host port 5555 to telnet port on
the guest, use the following:

	
	# on the host
	qemu-system-i386 -net user,hostfwd=tcp::5555-:23 [...]
	telnet localhost 5555


Then when you use on the host C<telnet localhost 5555>, you
connect to the guest telnet server.


=item B<guestfwd=[tcp]:>I<server>B<:>I<port>B<->I<dev>


=item B<guestfwd=[tcp]:>I<server>B<:>I<port>B<->I<cmd:command>

Forward guest TCP connections to the IP address I<server> on port I<port>
to the character device I<dev> or to a program executed by I<cmd:command>
which gets spawned for each connection. This option can be given multiple times.

You can either use a chardev directly and have that one used throughout QEMU's
lifetime, like in the following example:

	
	# open 10.10.1.1:4321 on bootup, connect 10.0.2.100:1234 to it whenever
	# the guest accesses it
	qemu -net user,guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.100:1234-tcp:10.10.1.1:4321 [...]


Or you can execute a command on every TCP connection established by the guest,
so that QEMU behaves similar to an inetd process for that virtual server:

	
	# call "netcat 10.10.1.1 4321" on every TCP connection to 10.0.2.100:1234
	# and connect the TCP stream to its stdin/stdout
	qemu -net 'user,guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.100:1234-cmd:netcat 10.10.1.1 4321'



=back


Note: Legacy stand-alone options -tftp, -bootp, -smb and -redir are still
processed and applied to -net user. Mixing them with the new configuration
syntax gives undefined results. Their use for new applications is discouraged
as they will be removed from future versions.

Connect the host TAP network interface I<name> to VLAN I<n>.

Use the network script I<file> to configure it and the network script
I<dfile> to deconfigure it. If I<name> is not provided, the OS
automatically provides one. The default network configure script is
F</etc/qemu-ifup> and the default network deconfigure script is
F</etc/qemu-ifdown>. Use B<script=no> or B<downscript=no>
to disable script execution.

If running QEMU as an unprivileged user, use the network helper
I<helper> to configure the TAP interface and attach it to the bridge.
The default network helper executable is F</path/to/qemu-bridge-helper>
and the default bridge device is F<br0>.

B<fd>=I<h> can be used to specify the handle of an already
opened host TAP interface.

Examples:

	
	#launch a QEMU instance with the default network script
	qemu-system-i386 linux.img -net nic -net tap


	
	#launch a QEMU instance with two NICs, each one connected
	#to a TAP device
	qemu-system-i386 linux.img \
	-net nic,vlan=0 -net tap,vlan=0,ifname=tap0 \
	-net nic,vlan=1 -net tap,vlan=1,ifname=tap1


	
	#launch a QEMU instance with the default network helper to
	#connect a TAP device to bridge br0
	qemu-system-i386 linux.img \
	-net nic -net tap,"helper=/path/to/qemu-bridge-helper"

=item B<-net bridge[,vlan=>I<n>B<][,name=>I<name>B<][,br=>I<bridge>B<][,helper=>I<helper>B<]>

Connect a host TAP network interface to a host bridge device.

Use the network helper I<helper> to configure the TAP interface and
attach it to the bridge. The default network helper executable is
F</path/to/qemu-bridge-helper> and the default bridge
device is F<br0>.

Examples:

	
	#launch a QEMU instance with the default network helper to
	#connect a TAP device to bridge br0
	qemu-system-i386 linux.img -net bridge -net nic,model=virtio


	
	#launch a QEMU instance with the default network helper to

Connect the VLAN I<n> to a remote VLAN in another QEMU virtual
machine using a TCP socket connection. If B<listen> is
specified, QEMU waits for incoming connections on I<port>
(I<host> is optional). B<connect> is used to connect to
another QEMU instance using the B<listen> option. B<fd>=I<h>
specifies an already opened TCP socket.

Example:
	
	# launch a first QEMU instance
	qemu-system-i386 linux.img \
	-net nic,macaddr=52:54:00:12:34:56 \
	-net socket,listen=:1234

Create a VLAN I<n> shared with another QEMU virtual
machines using a UDP multicast socket, effectively making a bus for
every QEMU with same multicast address I<maddr> and I<port>.
NOTES:

=over 4


=item 1.

Several QEMU can be running on different hosts and share same bus (assuming
correct multicast setup for these hosts).

mcast support is compatible with User Mode Linux (argument B<eth>I<N>B<=mcast>), see
E<lt>B<http://user-mode-linux.sf.net>E<gt>.

Connect VLAN I<n> to L2TPv3 pseudowire. L2TPv3 (RFC3391) is a popular
protocol to transport Ethernet (and other Layer 2) data frames between
two systems. It is present in routers, firewalls and the Linux kernel
(from version 3.3 onwards).

This transport allows a VM to communicate to another VM, router or firewall directly.


=item B<src=>I<srcaddr>

source address (mandatory)

=item B<dst=>I<dstaddr>

destination address (mandatory)

=item B<udp>

select udp encapsulation (default is ip).

=item B<srcport=>I<srcport>

source udp port.

=item B<dstport=>I<dstport>

destination udp port.

=item B<ipv6>

force v6, otherwise defaults to v4.

=item B<rxcookie=>I<rxcookie>


=item B<txcookie=>I<txcookie>

Cookies are a weak form of security in the l2tpv3 specification.
Their function is mostly to prevent misconfiguration. By default they are 32
bit.

=item B<cookie64>

Set cookie size to 64 bit instead of the default 32

=item B<counter=off>

Force a 'cut-down' L2TPv3 with no counter as in
draft-mkonstan-l2tpext-keyed-ipv6-tunnel-00

=item B<pincounter=on>

Work around broken counter handling in peer. This may also help on
networks which have packet reorder.

=item B<offset=>I<offset>

Add an extra offset between header and data

For example, to attach a VM running on host 4.3.2.1 via L2TPv3 to the bridge br-lan
on the remote Linux host 1.2.3.4:
	
	# Setup tunnel on linux host using raw ip as encapsulation
	# on 1.2.3.4
	ip l2tp add tunnel remote 4.3.2.1 local 1.2.3.4 tunnel_id 1 peer_tunnel_id 1 \
	encap udp udp_sport 16384 udp_dport 16384
	ip l2tp add session tunnel_id 1 name vmtunnel0 session_id \
	0xFFFFFFFF peer_session_id 0xFFFFFFFF
	ifconfig vmtunnel0 mtu 1500
	ifconfig vmtunnel0 up
	brctl addif br-lan vmtunnel0
	
	
	# on 4.3.2.1

Connect VLAN I<n> to PORT I<n> of a vde switch running on host and
listening for incoming connections on I<socketpath>. Use GROUP I<groupname>
and MODE I<octalmode> to change default ownership and permissions for
communication port. This option is only available if QEMU has been compiled
with vde support enabled.

Example:
	
	# launch vde switch
	vde_switch -F -sock /tmp/myswitch
	# launch QEMU instance
	qemu-system-i386 linux.img -net nic -net vde,sock=/tmp/myswitch



=item B<-netdev hubport,id=>I<id>B<,hubid=>I<hubid>


Create a hub port on QEMU "vlan" I<hubid>.

The hubport netdev lets you connect a NIC to a QEMU "vlan" instead of a single
netdev.  C<-net> and C<-device> with parameter B<vlan> create the
required hub automatically.


=item B<-netdev vhost-user,chardev=>I<id>B<[,vhostforce=on|off][,queues=n]>


Establish a vhost-user netdev, backed by a chardev I<id>. The chardev should
be a unix domain socket backed one. The vhost-user uses a specifically defined
protocol to pass vhost ioctl replacement messages to an application on the other
end of the socket. On non-MSIX guests, the feature can be forced with
I<vhostforce>. Use 'queues=I<n>' to specify the number of queues to
be created for multiqueue vhost-user.

Example:
	
	qemu -m 512 -object memory-backend-file,id=mem,size=512M,mem-path=/hugetlbfs,share=on \
	-numa node,memdev=mem \
	-chardev socket,path=/path/to/socket \
	-netdev type=vhost-user,id=net0,chardev=chr0 \
	-device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0



=item B<-net dump[,vlan=>I<n>B<][,file=>I<file>B<][,len=>I<len>B<]>

Dump network traffic on VLAN I<n> to file I<file> (F<qemu-vlan0.pcap> by default).
At most I<len> bytes (64k by default) per packet are stored. The file format is
libpcap, so it can be analyzed with tools such as tcpdump or Wireshark.
Note: For devices created with '-netdev', use '-object filter-dump,...' instead.


=item B<-net none>

Indicate that no network devices should be configured. It is used to
override the default configuration (B<-net nic -net user>) which
is activated if no B<-net> options are provided.

=head3 Character device options


The general form of a character device option is:

=over 4


=item B<-chardev> I<backend> B<,id=>I<id> B<[,mux=on|off] [,>I<options>B<]>

Backend is one of:
B<null>,
B<socket>,
B<udp>,
B<msmouse>,
B<vc>,
B<ringbuf>,
B<file>,
B<pipe>,
B<console>,
B<serial>,
B<pty>,
B<stdio>,
B<braille>,
B<tty>,
B<parallel>,
B<parport>,
B<spicevmc>.
B<spiceport>.
The specific backend will determine the applicable options.

Use "-chardev help" to print all available chardev backend types.

All devices must have an id, which can be any string up to 127 characters long.
It is used to uniquely identify this device in other command line directives.

A character device may be used in multiplexing mode by multiple front-ends.
Specify B<mux=on> to enable this mode.
A multiplexer is a "1:N" device, and here the "1" end is your specified chardev
backend, and the "N" end is the various parts of QEMU that can talk to a chardev.
If you create a chardev with B<id=myid> and B<mux=on>, QEMU will
create a multiplexer with your specified ID, and you can then configure multiple
front ends to use that chardev ID for their input/output. Up to four different
front ends can be connected to a single multiplexed chardev. (Without
multiplexing enabled, a chardev can only be used by a single front end.)
For instance you could use this to allow a single stdio chardev to be used by
two serial ports and the QEMU monitor:

	
	-chardev stdio,mux=on,id=char0 \
	-mon chardev=char0,mode=readline \
	-serial chardev:char0 \
	-serial chardev:char0


You can have more than one multiplexer in a system configuration; for instance
you could have a TCP port multiplexed between UART 0 and UART 1, and stdio
multiplexed between the QEMU monitor and a parallel port:

	
	-chardev stdio,mux=on,id=char0 \
	-mon chardev=char0,mode=readline \
	-parallel chardev:char0 \
	-chardev tcp,...,mux=on,id=char1 \
	-serial chardev:char1 \
	-serial chardev:char1


When you're using a multiplexed character device, some escape sequences are
interpreted in the input. 

Note that some other command line options may implicitly create multiplexed
character backends; for instance B<-serial mon:stdio> creates a
multiplexed stdio backend connected to the serial port and the QEMU monitor,
and B<-nographic> also multiplexes the console and the monitor to
stdio.

There is currently no support for multiplexing in the other direction
(where a single QEMU front end takes input and output from multiple chardevs).

Every backend supports the B<logfile> option, which supplies the path
to a file to record all data transmitted via the backend. The B<logappend>
option controls whether the log file will be truncated or appended to when
opened.

Further options to each backend are described below.


=item B<-chardev null ,id=>I<id>

A void device. This device will not emit any data, and will drop any data it
receives. The null backend does not take any options.


=item B<-chardev socket ,id=>I<id> B<[>I<TCP options> B<or> I<unix options>B<] [,server] [,nowait] [,telnet] [,reconnect=>I<seconds>B<] [,tls-creds=>I<id>B<]>


Create a two-way stream socket, which can be either a TCP or a unix socket. A
unix socket will be created if B<path> is specified. Behaviour is
undefined if TCP options are specified for a unix socket.

B<server> specifies that the socket shall be a listening socket.

B<nowait> specifies that QEMU should not block waiting for a client to
connect to a listening socket.

B<telnet> specifies that traffic on the socket should interpret telnet
escape sequences.

B<reconnect> sets the timeout for reconnecting on non-server sockets when
the remote end goes away.  qemu will delay this many seconds and then attempt
to reconnect.  Zero disables reconnecting, and is the default.

B<tls-creds> requests enablement of the TLS protocol for encryption,
and specifies the id of the TLS credentials to use for the handshake. The
credentials must be previously created with the B<-object tls-creds>
argument.

TCP and unix socket options are given below:


=over 4



=item B<TCP options: port=>I<port> B<[,host=>I<host>B<] [,to=>I<to>B<] [,ipv4] [,ipv6] [,nodelay]>


B<host> for a listening socket specifies the local address to be bound.
For a connecting socket species the remote host to connect to. B<host> is
optional for listening sockets. If not specified it defaults to C<0.0.0.0>.

B<port> for a listening socket specifies the local port to be bound. For a
connecting socket specifies the port on the remote host to connect to.
B<port> can be given as either a port number or a service name.
B<port> is required.

B<to> is only relevant to listening sockets. If it is specified, and
B<port> cannot be bound, QEMU will attempt to bind to subsequent ports up
to and including B<to> until it succeeds. B<to> must be specified
as a port number.

B<ipv4> and B<ipv6> specify that either IPv4 or IPv6 must be used.
If neither is specified the socket may use either protocol.

B<nodelay> disables the Nagle algorithm.


=item B<unix options: path=>I<path>


B<path> specifies the local path of the unix socket. B<path> is
required.


=back



=item B<-chardev udp ,id=>I<id> B<[,host=>I<host>B<] ,port=>I<port> B<[,localaddr=>I<localaddr>B<] [,localport=>I<localport>B<] [,ipv4] [,ipv6]>


Sends all traffic from the guest to a remote host over UDP.

B<host> specifies the remote host to connect to. If not specified it
defaults to C<localhost>.

B<port> specifies the port on the remote host to connect to. B<port>
is required.

B<localaddr> specifies the local address to bind to. If not specified it
defaults to C<0.0.0.0>.

B<localport> specifies the local port to bind to. If not specified any
available local port will be used.

B<ipv4> and B<ipv6> specify that either IPv4 or IPv6 must be used.
If neither is specified the device may use either protocol.


=item B<-chardev msmouse ,id=>I<id>


Forward QEMU's emulated msmouse events to the guest. B<msmouse> does not
take any options.


=item B<-chardev vc ,id=>I<id> B<[[,width=>I<width>B<] [,height=>I<height>B<]] [[,cols=>I<cols>B<] [,rows=>I<rows>B<]]>


Connect to a QEMU text console. B<vc> may optionally be given a specific
size.

B<width> and B<height> specify the width and height respectively of
the console, in pixels.

B<cols> and B<rows> specify that the console be sized to fit a text
console with the given dimensions.


=item B<-chardev ringbuf ,id=>I<id> B<[,size=>I<size>B<]>


Create a ring buffer with fixed size B<size>.
I<size> must be a power of two and defaults to C<64K>.


=item B<-chardev file ,id=>I<id> B<,path=>I<path>


Log all traffic received from the guest to a file.

B<path> specifies the path of the file to be opened. This file will be
created if it does not already exist, and overwritten if it does. B<path>
is required.


=item B<-chardev pipe ,id=>I<id> B<,path=>I<path>


Create a two-way connection to the guest. The behaviour differs slightly between
Windows hosts and other hosts:

On Windows, a single duplex pipe will be created at
F<\\.pipe\B<path>>.

On other hosts, 2 pipes will be created called F<B<path>.in> and
F<B<path>.out>. Data written to F<B<path>.in> will be
received by the guest. Data written by the guest can be read from
F<B<path>.out>. QEMU will not create these fifos, and requires them to
be present.

B<path> forms part of the pipe path as described above. B<path> is
required.


=item B<-chardev console ,id=>I<id>


Send traffic from the guest to QEMU's standard output. B<console> does not
take any options.

B<console> is only available on Windows hosts.


=item B<-chardev serial ,id=>I<id> B<,path=>B<path>


Send traffic from the guest to a serial device on the host.

On Unix hosts serial will actually accept any tty device,
not only serial lines.

B<path> specifies the name of the serial device to open.


=item B<-chardev pty ,id=>I<id>


Create a new pseudo-terminal on the host and connect to it. B<pty> does
not take any options.

B<pty> is not available on Windows hosts.


=item B<-chardev stdio ,id=>I<id> B<[,signal=on|off]>

Connect to standard input and standard output of the QEMU process.

B<signal> controls if signals are enabled on the terminal, that includes
exiting QEMU with the key sequence B<Control-c>. This option is enabled by
default, use B<signal=off> to disable it.


=item B<-chardev braille ,id=>I<id>

=head3 Device URL Syntax


In addition to using normal file images for the emulated storage devices,
QEMU can also use networked resources such as iSCSI devices. These are
specified using a special URL syntax.


=over 4


=item B<iSCSI>

iSCSI support allows QEMU to access iSCSI resources directly and use as
images for the guest storage. Both disk and cdrom images are supported.

Syntax for specifying iSCSI LUNs is
"iscsi://E<lt>target-ipE<gt>[:E<lt>portE<gt>]/E<lt>target-iqnE<gt>/E<lt>lunE<gt>"

By default qemu will use the iSCSI initiator-name
'iqn.2008-11.org.linux-kvm[:E<lt>nameE<gt>]' but this can also be set from the command
line or a configuration file.

Since version Qemu 2.4 it is possible to specify a iSCSI request timeout to detect
stalled requests and force a reestablishment of the session. The timeout
is specified in seconds. The default is 0 which means no timeout. Libiscsi
1.15.0 or greater is required for this feature.

Example (without authentication):
	
	qemu-system-i386 -iscsi initiator-name=iqn.2001-04.com.example:my-initiator \
	-cdrom iscsi://192.0.2.1/iqn.2001-04.com.example/2 \
	-drive file=iscsi://192.0.2.1/iqn.2001-04.com.example/1


Example (CHAP username/password via URL):
	
	qemu-system-i386 -drive file=iscsi://user%password@192.0.2.1/iqn.2001-04.com.example/1


Example (CHAP username/password via environment variables):
	
	LIBISCSI_CHAP_USERNAME="user" \
	LIBISCSI_CHAP_PASSWORD="password" \
	qemu-system-i386 -drive file=iscsi://192.0.2.1/iqn.2001-04.com.example/1


iSCSI support is an optional feature of QEMU and only available when
compiled and linked against libiscsi.

iSCSI parameters such as username and password can also be specified via
a configuration file. See qemu-doc for more information and examples.


=item B<NBD>

QEMU supports NBD (Network Block Devices) both using TCP protocol as well
as Unix Domain Sockets.

Syntax for specifying a NBD device using TCP
"nbd:E<lt>server-ipE<gt>:E<lt>portE<gt>[:exportname=E<lt>exportE<gt>]"

Syntax for specifying a NBD device using Unix Domain Sockets
"nbd:unix:E<lt>domain-socketE<gt>[:exportname=E<lt>exportE<gt>]"


Example for TCP
	
	qemu-system-i386 --drive file=nbd:192.0.2.1:30000


Example for Unix Domain Sockets
	
	qemu-system-i386 --drive file=nbd:unix:/tmp/nbd-socket



=item B<SSH>

QEMU supports SSH (Secure Shell) access to remote disks.

Examples:
	
	qemu-system-i386 -drive file=ssh://user@host/path/to/disk.img
	qemu-system-i386 -drive file.driver=ssh,file.user=user,file.host=host,file.port=22,file.path=/path/to/disk.img


Currently authentication must be done using ssh-agent.  Other
authentication methods may be supported in future.


=item B<Sheepdog>

Sheepdog is a distributed storage system for QEMU.
QEMU supports using either local sheepdog devices or remote networked
devices.

Syntax for specifying a sheepdog device
	
	sheepdog[+tcp|+unix]://[host:port]/vdiname[?socket=path][#snapid|#tag]


Example
	
	qemu-system-i386 --drive file=sheepdog://192.0.2.1:30000/MyVirtualMachine


See also E<lt>B<https://sheepdog.github.io/sheepdog/>E<gt>.


=item B<GlusterFS>

GlusterFS is a user space distributed file system.
QEMU supports the use of GlusterFS volumes for hosting VM disk images using
TCP, Unix Domain Sockets and RDMA transport protocols.

Syntax for specifying a VM disk image on GlusterFS volume is
	
	
	URI:
	gluster[+type]://[host[:port]]/volume/path[?socket=...][,debug=N][,logfile=...]
	
	JSON:
	'json:{"driver":"qcow2","file":{"driver":"gluster","volume":"testvol","path":"a.img","debug":N,"logfile":"...",
	                                 "server":[{"type":"tcp","host":"...","port":"..."},
	                                           {"type":"unix","socket":"..."}]}}'



Example

=item B<readahead>

The amount of data to read ahead with each range request to the remote server.
This value may optionally have the suffix 'T', 'G', 'M', 'K', 'k' or 'b'. If it
does not have a suffix, it will be assumed to be in bytes. The value must be a
multiple of 512 bytes. It defaults to 256k.


=item B<sslverify>

Whether to verify the remote server's certificate when connecting over SSL. It
can have the value 'on' or 'off'. It defaults to 'on'.


=item B<cookie>

Send this cookie (it can also be a list of cookies separated by ';') with
each outgoing request.  Only supported when using protocols such as HTTP
which support cookies, otherwise ignored.


=item B<timeout>

Set the timeout in seconds of the CURL connection. This timeout is the time
that CURL waits for a response from the remote server to get the size of the
image to be downloaded. If not set, the default timeout of 5 seconds is used.

=back


Note that when passing options to qemu explicitly, B<driver> is the value
of E<lt>protocolE<gt>.

Example: boot from a remote Fedora 20 live ISO image
	
	qemu-system-x86_64 --drive media=cdrom,file=http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/20/Live/x86_64/Fedora-Live-Desktop-x86_64-20-1.iso,readonly

=head3 Bluetooth(R) options


=over 4


=item B<-bt hci[...]>

Defines the function of the corresponding Bluetooth HCI.  -bt options
are matched with the HCIs present in the chosen machine type.  For
example when emulating a machine with only one HCI built into it, only
the first C<-bt hci[...]> option is valid and defines the HCI's
logic.  The Transport Layer is decided by the machine type.  Currently
the machines C<n800> and C<n810> have one HCI and all other
machines have none.


The following three types are recognized:


=over 4


=item B<-bt hci,null>

(default) The corresponding Bluetooth HCI assumes no internal logic
and will not respond to any HCI commands or emit events.


=item B<-bt hci,host[:>I<id>B<]>

(C<bluez> only) The corresponding HCI passes commands / events
to / from the physical HCI identified by the name I<id> (default:
C<hci0>) on the computer running QEMU.  Only available on C<bluez>
capable systems like Linux.


=item B<-bt hci[,vlan=>I<n>B<]>

Add a virtual, standard HCI that will participate in the Bluetooth
scatternet I<n> (default C<0>).  Similarly to B<-net>
VLANs, devices inside a bluetooth network I<n> can only communicate
with other devices in the same network (scatternet).

=back



=item B<-bt vhci[,vlan=>I<n>B<]>

(Linux-host only) Create a HCI in scatternet I<n> (default 0) attached
to the host bluetooth stack instead of to the emulated target.  This
allows the host and target machines to participate in a common scatternet
and communicate.  Requires the Linux C<vhci> driver installed.  Can
be used as following:

	
	qemu-system-i386 [...OPTIONS...] -bt hci,vlan=5 -bt vhci,vlan=5



=item B<-bt device:>I<dev>B<[,vlan=>I<n>B<]>

Emulate a bluetooth device I<dev> and place it in network I<n>
(default C<0>).  QEMU can only emulate one type of bluetooth devices
currently:

=head3 TPM device options


The general form of a TPM device option is:

=over 4



=item B<-tpmdev> I<backend> B<,id=>I<id> B<[,>I<options>B<]>

Backend type must be:
B<passthrough>.

The specific backend type will determine the applicable options.
The C<-tpmdev> option creates the TPM backend and requires a
C<-device> option that specifies the TPM frontend interface model.

Options to each backend are described below.

Use 'help' to print all available TPM backend types.
	
	qemu -tpmdev help



=item B<-tpmdev passthrough, id=>I<id>B<, path=>I<path>B<, cancel-path=>I<cancel-path>


(Linux-host only) Enable access to the host's TPM using the passthrough
driver.

B<path> specifies the path to the host's TPM device, i.e., on
a Linux host this would be C</dev/tpm0>.
B<path> is optional and by default C</dev/tpm0> is used.

B<cancel-path> specifies the path to the host TPM device's sysfs
entry allowing for cancellation of an ongoing TPM command.
B<cancel-path> is optional and by default QEMU will search for the
sysfs entry to use.

Some notes about using the host's TPM with the passthrough driver:

The TPM device accessed by the passthrough driver must not be
used by any other application on the host.

Since the host's firmware (BIOS/UEFI) has already initialized the TPM,
the VM's firmware (BIOS/UEFI) will not be able to initialize the
TPM again and may therefore not show a TPM-specific menu that would
otherwise allow the user to configure the TPM, e.g., allow the user to
enable/disable or activate/deactivate the TPM.
Further, if TPM ownership is released from within a VM then the host's TPM
will get disabled and deactivated. To enable and activate the
TPM again afterwards, the host has to be rebooted and the user is
required to enter the firmware's menu to enable and activate the TPM.
If the TPM is left disabled and/or deactivated most TPM commands will fail.

To create a passthrough TPM use the following two options:
	
	-tpmdev passthrough,id=tpm0 -device tpm-tis,tpmdev=tpm0

Note that the C<-tpmdev> id is C<tpm0> and is referenced by
C<tpmdev=tpm0> in the device option.


=back



=head3 Linux/Multiboot boot specific


When using these options, you can use a given Linux or Multiboot
kernel without installing it in the disk image. It can be useful
for easier testing of various kernels.


=over 4


=item B<-kernel> I<bzImage>

Use I<bzImage> as kernel image. The kernel can be either a Linux kernel
or in multiboot format.

=item B<-append> I<cmdline>

Use I<cmdline> as kernel command line

=item B<-initrd> I<file>

Use I<file> as initial ram disk.


=item B<-initrd ">I<file1> B<arg=foo,>I<file2>B<">


This syntax is only available with multiboot.

Use I<file1> and I<file2> as modules and pass arg=foo as parameter to the
first module.

=item B<-dtb> I<file>

Use I<file> as a device tree binary (dtb) image and pass it to the kernel
on boot.

=back


=head3 Debug/Expert options


=over 4



=item B<-fw_cfg [name=]>I<name>B<,file=>I<file>

Add named fw_cfg entry with contents from file I<file>.


=item B<-fw_cfg [name=]>I<name>B<,string=>I<str>

Add named fw_cfg entry with contents from string I<str>.

The terminating NUL character of the contents of I<str> will not be
included as part of the fw_cfg item data. To insert contents with
embedded NUL characters, you have to use the I<file> parameter.

The fw_cfg entries are passed by QEMU through to the guest.

Example:
	
	-fw_cfg name=opt/com.mycompany/blob,file=./my_blob.bin

creates an fw_cfg entry named opt/com.mycompany/blob with contents
from ./my_blob.bin.


=item B<-serial> I<dev>

Redirect the virtual serial port to host character device
I<dev>. The default device is C<vc> in graphical mode and
C<stdio> in non graphical mode.

This option can be used several times to simulate up to 4 serial
ports.

Use C<-serial none> to disable all serial ports.

Available character devices are:

=over 4


=item B<vc[:>I<W>B<x>I<H>B<]>

Virtual console. Optionally, a width and height can be given in pixel with
	
	vc:800x600

It is also possible to specify width or height in characters:
	
	vc:80Cx24C


=item B<pty>

[Linux only] Pseudo TTY (a new PTY is automatically allocated)

=item B<none>

No device is allocated.

=item B<null>

void device

=item B<chardev:>I<id>

Use a named character device defined with the C<-chardev> option.

=item B</dev/XXX>

[Linux only] Use host tty, e.g. F</dev/ttyS0>. The host serial port
parameters are set according to the emulated ones.

=item B</dev/parport>I<N>

[Linux only, parallel port only] Use host parallel port
I<N>. Currently SPP and EPP parallel port features can be used.

=item B<file:>I<filename>

Write output to I<filename>. No character can be read.

=item B<stdio>

[Unix only] standard input/output

=item B<pipe:>I<filename>

name pipe I<filename>

=item B<COM>I<n>

[Windows only] Use host serial port I<n>

=item B<udp:[>I<remote_host>B<]:>I<remote_port>B<[@[>I<src_ip>B<]:>I<src_port>B<]>

This implements UDP Net Console.
When I<remote_host> or I<src_ip> are not specified
they default to C<0.0.0.0>.
When not using a specified I<src_port> a random port is automatically chosen.

If you just want a simple readonly console you can use C<netcat> or
C<nc>, by starting QEMU with: C<-serial udp::4555> and nc as:
C<nc -u -l -p 4555>. Any time QEMU writes something to that port it
will appear in the netconsole session.

If you plan to send characters back via netconsole or you want to stop
and start QEMU a lot of times, you should have QEMU use the same
source port each time by using something like C<-serial
udp::4555@4556> to QEMU. Another approach is to use a patched
version of netcat which can listen to a TCP port and send and receive
characters via udp.  If you have a patched version of netcat which
activates telnet remote echo and single char transfer, then you can
use the following options to set up a netcat redirector to allow
telnet on port 5555 to access the QEMU port.

=over 4


=item C<QEMU Options:>

-serial udp::4555@4556

=item C<netcat options:>

=back



=item B<tcp:[>I<host>B<]:>I<port>B<[,>I<server>B<][,nowait][,nodelay][,reconnect=>I<seconds>B<]>

The TCP Net Console has two modes of operation.  It can send the serial
I/O to a location or wait for a connection from a location.  By default
the TCP Net Console is sent to I<host> at the I<port>.  If you use
the I<server> option QEMU will wait for a client socket application
to connect to the port before continuing, unless the C<nowait>
option was specified.  The C<nodelay> option disables the Nagle buffering
algorithm.  The C<reconnect> option only applies if I<noserver> is
set, if the connection goes down it will attempt to reconnect at the
given interval.  If I<host> is omitted, 0.0.0.0 is assumed. Only
one TCP connection at a time is accepted. You can use C<telnet> to
connect to the corresponding character device.

=over 4


=item C<Example to send tcp console to 192.168.0.2 port 4444>

-serial tcp:192.168.0.2:4444

=item C<Example to not wait and listen on ip 192.168.0.100 port 4444>

-serial tcp:192.168.0.100:4444,server,nowait

=back



=item B<telnet:>I<host>B<:>I<port>B<[,server][,nowait][,nodelay]>

The telnet protocol is used instead of raw tcp sockets.  The options
work the same as if you had specified C<-serial tcp>.  The
difference is that the port acts like a telnet server or client using
telnet option negotiation.  This will also allow you to send the
MAGIC_SYSRQ sequence if you use a telnet that supports sending the break
sequence.  Typically in unix telnet you do it with Control-] and then
type "send break" followed by pressing the enter key.


=item B<unix:>I<path>B<[,server][,nowait][,reconnect=>I<seconds>B<]>

A unix domain socket is used instead of a tcp socket.  The option works the
same as if you had specified C<-serial tcp> except the unix domain socket
I<path> is used for connections.


=item B<mon:>I<dev_string>

This is a special option to allow the monitor to be multiplexed onto
another serial port.  The monitor is accessed with key sequence of
B<Control-a> and then pressing B<c>.
I<dev_string> should be any one of the serial devices specified
above.  An example to multiplex the monitor onto a telnet server
listening on port 4444 would be:

=over 4


=item C<-serial mon:telnet::4444,server,nowait>


=back

When the monitor is multiplexed to stdio in this way, Ctrl+C will not terminate
QEMU any more but will be passed to the guest instead.


=item B<braille>

Braille device.  This will use BrlAPI to display the braille output on a real
or fake device.


=item B<msmouse>

Three button serial mouse. Configure the guest to use Microsoft protocol.

=back


=item B<-parallel> I<dev>

Redirect the virtual parallel port to host device I<dev> (same
devices as the serial port). On Linux hosts, F</dev/parportN> can
be used to use hardware devices connected on the corresponding host
parallel port.

This option can be used several times to simulate up to 3 parallel
ports.

Use C<-parallel none> to disable all parallel ports.

=item B<-monitor> I<dev>

Redirect the monitor to host device I<dev> (same devices as the
serial port).
The default device is C<vc> in graphical mode and C<stdio> in
non graphical mode.
Use C<-monitor none> to disable the default monitor.

=item B<-qmp> I<dev>

Like -monitor but opens in 'control' mode.

=item B<-qmp-pretty> I<dev>

Like -qmp but uses pretty JSON formatting.

=item B<-mon [chardev=]name[,mode=readline|control]>

Setup monitor on chardev I<name>.

=item B<-debugcon> I<dev>

Redirect the debug console to host device I<dev> (same devices as the
serial port).  The debug console is an I/O port which is typically port
0xe9; writing to that I/O port sends output to this device.
The default device is C<vc> in graphical mode and C<stdio> in
non graphical mode.

=item B<-pidfile> I<file>

Store the QEMU process PID in I<file>. It is useful if you launch QEMU
from a script.

=item B<-singlestep>

Run the emulation in single step mode.

=item B<-S>

Do not start CPU at startup (you must type 'c' in the monitor).

=item B<-realtime mlock=on|off>

Run qemu with realtime features.
mlocking qemu and guest memory can be enabled via B<mlock=on>
(enabled by default).

=item B<-gdb> I<dev>

Wait for gdb connection on device I<dev>. Typical
connections will likely be TCP-based, but also UDP, pseudo TTY, or even
stdio are reasonable use case. The latter is allowing to start QEMU from
within gdb and establish the connection via a pipe:
	
	(gdb) target remote | exec qemu-system-i386 -gdb stdio ...


=item B<-s>

Shorthand for -gdb tcp::1234, i.e. open a gdbserver on TCP port 1234.

=item B<-d> I<item1>B<[,...]>

Enable logging of specified items. Use '-d help' for a list of log items.

=item B<-D> I<logfile>

Output log in I<logfile> instead of to stderr

=item B<-dfilter> I<range1>B<[,...]>

Filter debug output to that relevant to a range of target addresses. The filter
spec can be either I<start>+I<size>, I<start>-I<size> or
I<start>..I<end> where I<start> I<end> and I<size> are the
addresses and sizes required. For example:
	
	-dfilter 0x8000..0x8fff,0xffffffc000080000+0x200,0xffffffc000060000-0x1000

Will dump output for any code in the 0x1000 sized block starting at 0x8000 and
the 0x200 sized block starting at 0xffffffc000080000 and another 0x1000 sized
block starting at 0xffffffc00005f000.

=item B<-L>  I<path>

Set the directory for the BIOS, VGA BIOS and keymaps.

To list all the data directories, use C<-L help>.

=item B<-bios> I<file>

Set the filename for the BIOS.

=item B<-enable-kvm>

Enable KVM full virtualization support. This option is only available
if KVM support is enabled when compiling.

=item B<-enable-hax>

Enable HAX (Hardware-based Acceleration eXecution) support. This option
is only available if HAX support is enabled when compiling. HAX is only
applicable to MAC and Windows platform, and thus does not conflict with
KVM.

=item B<-xen-domid> I<id>

Specify xen guest domain I<id> (XEN only).

=item B<-xen-create>

Create domain using xen hypercalls, bypassing xend.
Warning: should not be used when xend is in use (XEN only).

=item B<-xen-attach>

Attach to existing xen domain.
xend will use this when starting QEMU (XEN only).

=item B<-no-reboot>

Exit instead of rebooting.

=item B<-no-shutdown>

Don't exit QEMU on guest shutdown, but instead only stop the emulation.
This allows for instance switching to monitor to commit changes to the
disk image.

=item B<-loadvm> I<file>

Start right away with a saved state (C<loadvm> in monitor)

=item B<-daemonize>

Daemonize the QEMU process after initialization.  QEMU will not detach from
standard IO until it is ready to receive connections on any of its devices.
This option is a useful way for external programs to launch QEMU without having
to cope with initialization race conditions.

=item B<-option-rom> I<file>

Load the contents of I<file> as an option ROM.
This option is useful to load things like EtherBoot.


=item B<-rtc [base=utc|localtime|>I<date>B<][,clock=host|vm][,driftfix=none|slew]>

Specify B<base> as C<utc> or C<localtime> to let the RTC start at the current
UTC or local time, respectively. C<localtime> is required for correct date in
MS-DOS or Windows. To start at a specific point in time, provide I<date> in the
format C<2006-06-17T16:01:21> or C<2006-06-17>. The default base is UTC.

By default the RTC is driven by the host system time. This allows using of the
RTC as accurate reference clock inside the guest, specifically if the host
time is smoothly following an accurate external reference clock, e.g. via NTP.
If you want to isolate the guest time from the host, you can set B<clock>
to C<rt> instead.  To even prevent it from progressing during suspension,
you can set it to C<vm>.

Enable B<driftfix> (i386 targets only) if you experience time drift problems,
specifically with Windows' ACPI HAL. This option will try to figure out how
many timer interrupts were not processed by the Windows guest and will
re-inject them.

=item B<-icount [shift=>I<N>B<|auto][,rr=record|replay,rrfile=>I<filename>B<,rrsnapshot=>I<snapshot>B<]>

Enable virtual instruction counter.  The virtual cpu will execute one
instruction every 2^I<N> ns of virtual time.  If C<auto> is specified
then the virtual cpu speed will be automatically adjusted to keep virtual
time within a few seconds of real time.

When the virtual cpu is sleeping, the virtual time will advance at default
speed unless B<sleep=on|off> is specified.
With B<sleep=on|off>, the virtual time will jump to the next timer deadline
instantly whenever the virtual cpu goes to sleep mode and will not advance
if no timer is enabled. This behavior give deterministic execution times from
the guest point of view.

Note that while this option can give deterministic behavior, it does not
provide cycle accurate emulation.  Modern CPUs contain superscalar out of
order cores with complex cache hierarchies.  The number of instructions
executed often has little or no correlation with actual performance.

B<align=on> will activate the delay algorithm which will try
to synchronise the host clock and the virtual clock. The goal is to
have a guest running at the real frequency imposed by the shift option.
Whenever the guest clock is behind the host clock and if
B<align=on> is specified then we print a message to the user
to inform about the delay.
Currently this option does not work when B<shift> is C<auto>.
Note: The sync algorithm will work for those shift values for which
the guest clock runs ahead of the host clock. Typically this happens
when the shift value is high (how high depends on the host machine).

When B<rr> option is specified deterministic record/replay is enabled.
Replay log is written into I<filename> file in record mode and
read from this file in replay mode.

Option rrsnapshot is used to create new vm snapshot named I<snapshot>
at the start of execution recording. In replay mode this option is used
to load the initial VM state.

=item B<-watchdog> I<model>

Create a virtual hardware watchdog device.  Once enabled (by a guest
action), the watchdog must be periodically polled by an agent inside
the guest or else the guest will be restarted. Choose a model for
which your guest has drivers.

The I<model> is the model of hardware watchdog to emulate. Use
C<-watchdog help> to list available hardware models. Only one
watchdog can be enabled for a guest.

The following models may be available:

=over 4


=item B<ib700>

iBASE 700 is a very simple ISA watchdog with a single timer.

=item B<i6300esb>

Intel 6300ESB I/O controller hub is a much more featureful PCI-based
dual-timer watchdog.

=item B<diag288>

A virtual watchdog for s390x backed by the diagnose 288 hypercall
(currently KVM only).

=back


=item B<-watchdog-action> I<action>


The I<action> controls what QEMU will do when the watchdog timer
expires.
The default is
C<reset> (forcefully reset the guest).
Other possible actions are:
C<shutdown> (attempt to gracefully shutdown the guest),
C<poweroff> (forcefully poweroff the guest),
C<pause> (pause the guest),
C<debug> (print a debug message and continue), or
C<none> (do nothing).

Note that the C<shutdown> action requires that the guest responds
to ACPI signals, which it may not be able to do in the sort of
situations where the watchdog would have expired, and thus
C<-watchdog-action shutdown> is not recommended for production use.

Examples:

=item B<-echr> I<numeric_ascii_value>

Change the escape character used for switching to the monitor when using
monitor and serial sharing.  The default is C<0x01> when using the
C<-nographic> option.  C<0x01> is equal to pressing
C<Control-a>.  You can select a different character from the ascii
control keys where 1 through 26 map to Control-a through Control-z.  For
instance you could use the either of the following to change the escape
character to Control-t.

Prepare for incoming migration, listen on a given tcp port.


=item B<-incoming unix:>I<socketpath>

Prepare for incoming migration, listen on a given unix socket.


=item B<-incoming fd:>I<fd>

Accept incoming migration from a given filedescriptor.


=item B<-incoming exec:>I<cmdline>

Accept incoming migration as an output from specified external command.


=item B<-incoming defer>

Wait for the URI to be specified via migrate_incoming.  The monitor can
be used to change settings (such as migration parameters) prior to issuing
the migrate_incoming to allow the migration to begin.

=item B<-only-migratable>

Only allow migratable devices. Devices will not be allowed to enter an
unmigratable state.

=item B<-nodefaults>

Don't create default devices. Normally, QEMU sets the default devices like serial
port, parallel port, virtual console, monitor device, VGA adapter, floppy and
CD-ROM drive and others. The C<-nodefaults> option will disable all those
default devices.

=item B<-chroot> I<dir>

Immediately before starting guest execution, chroot to the specified
directory.  Especially useful in combination with -runas.

=item B<-runas> I<user>

Immediately before starting guest execution, drop root privileges, switching
to the specified user.

=item B<-prom-env> I<variable>B<=>I<value>

Set OpenBIOS nvram I<variable> to given I<value> (PPC, SPARC only).

=item B<-semihosting>

Enable semihosting mode (ARM, M68K, Xtensa, MIPS only).

=item B<-semihosting-config [enable=on|off][,target=native|gdb|auto][,arg=str[,...]]>

Enable and configure semihosting (ARM, M68K, Xtensa, MIPS only).

=over 4


=item B<target=C<native|gdb|auto>>

Defines where the semihosting calls will be addressed, to QEMU (C<native>)
or to GDB (C<gdb>). The default is C<auto>, which means C<gdb>
during debug sessions and C<native> otherwise.

=item B<arg=>I<str1>B<,arg=>I<str2>B<,...>

Allows the user to pass input arguments, and can be used multiple times to build
up a list. The old-style C<-kernel>/C<-append> method of passing a
command line is still supported for backward compatibility. If both the
C<--semihosting-config arg> and the C<-kernel>/C<-append> are
specified, the former is passed to semihosting as it always takes precedence.

=back


=item B<-old-param>

Old param mode (ARM only).

=item B<-sandbox> I<arg>

Enable Seccomp mode 2 system call filter. 'on' will enable syscall filtering and 'off' will
disable it.  The default is 'off'.

=item B<-readconfig> I<file>

Read device configuration from I<file>. This approach is useful when you want to spawn
QEMU process with many command line options but you don't want to exceed the command line
character limit.

=item B<-writeconfig> I<file>

Write device configuration to I<file>. The I<file> can be either filename to save
command line and device configuration into file or dash C<->) character to print the
output to stdout. This can be later used as input file for C<-readconfig> option.

=item B<-nodefconfig>

Normally QEMU loads configuration files from I<sysconfdir> and I<datadir> at startup.
The C<-nodefconfig> option will prevent QEMU from loading any of those config files.

=item B<-no-user-config>

The C<-no-user-config> option makes QEMU not load any of the user-provided
config files on I<sysconfdir>, but won't make it skip the QEMU-provided config
files from I<datadir>.

=item B<-trace [[enable=]>I<pattern>B<][,events=>I<file>B<][,file=>I<file>B<]>

Specify tracing options.


=over 4


=item B<[enable=]>I<pattern>

Immediately enable events matching I<pattern>.
The file must contain one event name (as listed in the F<trace-events-all>
file) per line; globbing patterns are accepted too.  This option is only
available if QEMU has been compiled with the I<simple>, I<log>
or I<ftrace> tracing backend.  To specify multiple events or patterns,
specify the B<-trace> option multiple times.

Use C<-trace help> to print a list of names of trace points.


=item B<events=>I<file>

Immediately enable events listed in I<file>.
The file must contain one event name (as listed in the F<trace-events-all>
file) per line; globbing patterns are accepted too.  This option is only
available if QEMU has been compiled with the I<simple>, I<log> or
I<ftrace> tracing backend.

property must be set.  These objects are placed in the
'/objects' path.


=over 4



=item B<-object memory-backend-file,id=>I<id>B<,size=>I<size>B<,mem-path=>I<dir>B<,share=>I<on|off>


Creates a memory file backend object, which can be used to back
the guest RAM with huge pages. The B<id> parameter is a
unique ID that will be used to reference this memory region
when configuring the B<-numa> argument. The B<size>
option provides the size of the memory region, and accepts
common suffixes, eg B<500M>. The B<mem-path> provides
the path to either a shared memory or huge page filesystem mount.
The B<share> boolean option determines whether the memory
region is marked as private to QEMU, or shared. The latter allows
a co-operating external process to access the QEMU memory region.


=item B<-object rng-random,id=>I<id>B<,filename=>I</dev/random>


Creates a random number generator backend which obtains entropy from
a device on the host. The B<id> parameter is a unique ID that
will be used to reference this entropy backend from the B<virtio-rng>
device. The B<filename> parameter specifies which file to obtain
entropy from and if omitted defaults to B</dev/random>.


=item B<-object rng-egd,id=>I<id>B<,chardev=>I<chardevid>


Creates a random number generator backend which obtains entropy from
an external daemon running on the host. The B<id> parameter is
a unique ID that will be used to reference this entropy backend from
the B<virtio-rng> device. The B<chardev> parameter is
the unique ID of a character device backend that provides the connection
to the RNG daemon.


=item B<-object tls-creds-anon,id=>I<id>B<,endpoint=>I<endpoint>B<,dir=>I</path/to/cred/dir>B<,verify-peer=>I<on|off>


Creates a TLS anonymous credentials object, which can be used to provide
TLS support on network backends. The B<id> parameter is a unique
ID which network backends will use to access the credentials. The
B<endpoint> is either B<server> or B<client> depending
on whether the QEMU network backend that uses the credentials will be
acting as a client or as a server. If B<verify-peer> is enabled
(the default) then once the handshake is completed, the peer credentials
will be verified, though this is a no-op for anonymous credentials.

The I<dir> parameter tells QEMU where to find the credential
files. For server endpoints, this directory may contain a file
I<dh-params.pem> providing diffie-hellman parameters to use
for the TLS server. If the file is missing, QEMU will generate
a set of DH parameters at startup. This is a computationally
expensive operation that consumes random pool entropy, so it is
recommended that a persistent set of parameters be generated
upfront and saved.


=item B<-object tls-creds-x509,id=>I<id>B<,endpoint=>I<endpoint>B<,dir=>I</path/to/cred/dir>B<,verify-peer=>I<on|off>B<,passwordid=>I<id>


Creates a TLS anonymous credentials object, which can be used to provide
TLS support on network backends. The B<id> parameter is a unique
ID which network backends will use to access the credentials. The
B<endpoint> is either B<server> or B<client> depending
on whether the QEMU network backend that uses the credentials will be
acting as a client or as a server. If B<verify-peer> is enabled
(the default) then once the handshake is completed, the peer credentials
will be verified. With x509 certificates, this implies that the clients
must be provided with valid client certificates too.

The I<dir> parameter tells QEMU where to find the credential
files. For server endpoints, this directory may contain a file
I<dh-params.pem> providing diffie-hellman parameters to use
for the TLS server. If the file is missing, QEMU will generate
a set of DH parameters at startup. This is a computationally
expensive operation that consumes random pool entropy, so it is
recommended that a persistent set of parameters be generated
upfront and saved.

For x509 certificate credentials the directory will contain further files
providing the x509 certificates. The certificates must be stored
in PEM format, in filenames I<ca-cert.pem>, I<ca-crl.pem> (optional),
I<server-cert.pem> (only servers), I<server-key.pem> (only servers),
I<client-cert.pem> (only clients), and I<client-key.pem> (only clients).

For the I<server-key.pem> and I<client-key.pem> files which
contain sensitive private keys, it is possible to use an encrypted
version by providing the I<passwordid> parameter. This provides
the ID of a previously created C<secret> object containing the
password for decryption.


=item B<-object filter-buffer,id=>I<id>B<,netdev=>I<netdevid>B<,interval=>I<t>B<[,queue=>I<all|rx|tx>B<][,status=>I<on|off>B<]>


Interval I<t> can't be 0, this filter batches the packet delivery: all
packets arriving in a given interval on netdev I<netdevid> are delayed
until the end of the interval. Interval is in microseconds.
B<status> is optional that indicate whether the netfilter is
on (enabled) or off (disabled), the default status for netfilter will be 'on'.

queue I<all|rx|tx> is an option that can be applied to any netfilter.

B<all>: the filter is attached both to the receive and the transmit
queue of the netdev (default).

B<rx>: the filter is attached to the receive queue of the netdev,
where it will receive packets sent to the netdev.

B<tx>: the filter is attached to the transmit queue of the netdev,
where it will receive packets sent by the netdev.


=item B<-object filter-mirror,id=>I<id>B<,netdev=>I<netdevid>B<,outdev=>I<chardevid>B<[,queue=>I<all|rx|tx>B<]>

outdev=I<chardevid>[,queue=I<all|rx|tx>]

filter-redirector on netdev I<netdevid>,redirect filter's net packet to chardev
I<chardevid>,and redirect indev's packet to filter.
Create a filter-redirector we need to differ outdev id from indev id, id can not
be the same. we can just use indev or outdev, but at least one of indev or outdev
need to be specified.


=item B<-object filter-rewriter,id=>I<id>B<,netdev=>I<netdevid>B<,rewriter-mode=>I<mode>B<[,queue=>I<all|rx|tx>B<]>


Filter-rewriter is a part of COLO project.It will rewrite tcp packet to
secondary from primary to keep secondary tcp connection,and rewrite
tcp packet to primary from secondary make tcp packet can be handled by
client.

usage:

=item B<-object filter-dump,id=>I<id>B<,netdev=>I<dev>B<[,file=>I<filename>B<][,maxlen=>I<len>B<]>


Dump the network traffic on netdev I<dev> to the file specified by
I<filename>. At most I<len> bytes (64k by default) per packet are stored.
The file format is libpcap, so it can be analyzed with tools such as tcpdump
or Wireshark.


=item B<-object colo-compare,id=>I<id>B<,primary_in=>I<chardevid>B<,secondary_in=>I<chardevid>B<,>

outdev=I<chardevid>

Colo-compare gets packet from primary_inI<chardevid> and secondary_inI<chardevid>, than compare primary packet with
secondary packet. If the packets are same, we will output primary
packet to outdevI<chardevid>, else we will notify colo-frame
do checkpoint and send primary packet to outdevI<chardevid>.

we must use it with the help of filter-mirror and filter-redirector.

=item B<-object secret,id=>I<id>B<,data=>I<string>B<,format=>I<raw|base64>B<[,keyid=>I<secretid>B<,iv=>I<string>B<]>


=item B<-object secret,id=>I<id>B<,file=>I<filename>B<,format=>I<raw|base64>B<[,keyid=>I<secretid>B<,iv=>I<string>B<]>


Defines a secret to store a password, encryption key, or some other sensitive
data. The sensitive data can either be passed directly via the I<data>
parameter, or indirectly via the I<file> parameter. Using the I<data>
parameter is insecure unless the sensitive data is encrypted.

The sensitive data can be provided in raw format (the default), or base64.
When encoded as JSON, the raw format only supports valid UTF-8 characters,
so base64 is recommended for sending binary data. QEMU will convert from
which ever format is provided to the format it needs internally. eg, an
RBD password can be provided in raw format, even though it will be base64
encoded when passed onto the RBD sever.

For added protection, it is possible to encrypt the data associated with
a secret using the AES-256-CBC cipher. Use of encryption is indicated
by providing the I<keyid> and I<iv> parameters. The I<keyid>
parameter provides the ID of a previously defined secret that contains
the AES-256 decryption key. This key should be 32-bytes long and be
base64 encoded. The I<iv> parameter provides the random initialization
vector used for encryption of this particular secret and should be a
base64 encrypted string of the 16-byte IV.

The simplest (insecure) usage is to provide the secret inline

	
	
	# $QEMU -object secret,id=sec0,data=letmein,format=raw
	


The simplest secure usage is to provide the secret via a file

# echo -n "letmein" E<gt> mypasswd.txt
# $QEMU -object secret,id=sec0,file=mypasswd.txt,format=raw

For greater security, AES-256-CBC should be used. To illustrate usage,
consider the openssl command line tool which can encrypt the data. Note
that when encrypting, the plaintext must be padded to the cipher block
size (32 bytes) using the standard PKCS#5/6 compatible padding algorithm.

First a master key needs to be created in base64 encoding:

	
	# openssl rand -base64 32 > key.b64
	# KEY=$(base64 -d key.b64 | hexdump  -v -e '/1 "%02X"')


Each secret to be encrypted needs to have a random initialization vector
generated. These do not need to be kept secret

	
	# openssl rand -base64 16 > iv.b64
	# IV=$(base64 -d iv.b64 | hexdump  -v -e '/1 "%02X"')


The secret to be defined can now be encrypted, in this case we're
telling openssl to base64 encode the result, but it could be left
as raw bytes if desired.

	
	# SECRET=$(echo -n "letmein" |
	openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -K $KEY -iv $IV)


When launching QEMU, create a master secret pointing to C<key.b64>
and specify that to be used to decrypt the user password. Pass the
contents of C<iv.b64> to the second secret

	
	# $QEMU \
	-object secret,id=secmaster0,format=base64,file=key.b64 \
	-object secret,id=sec0,keyid=secmaster0,format=base64,\
	data=$SECRET,iv=$(<iv.b64)
