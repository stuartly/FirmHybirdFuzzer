=head1 NAME

qemu-nbd - QEMU Disk Network Block Device Server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<qemu-nbd> [OPTION]... I<filename>

B<qemu-nbd> B<-d> I<dev>

=head1 DESCRIPTION


Export a QEMU disk image using the NBD protocol.


=head1 OPTIONS

I<filename> is a disk image filename, or a set of block
driver options if I<--image-opts> is specified.

I<dev> is an NBD device.


=over 4


=item B<--object type,id=>I<id>B<,...props...>

Define a new instance of the I<type> object class identified by I<id>.
See the C<qemu(1)> manual page for full details of the properties
supported. The common object types that it makes sense to define are the
C<secret> object, which is used to supply passwords and/or encryption
keys, and the C<tls-creds> object, which is used to supply TLS
credentials for the qemu-nbd server.

=item B<-p, --port=>I<port>

The TCP port to listen on (default B<10809>)

=item B<-o, --offset=>I<offset>

The offset into the image

=item B<-b, --bind=>I<iface>

The interface to bind to (default B<0.0.0.0>)

=item B<-k, --socket=>I<path>

Use a unix socket with path I<path>

=item B<--image-opts>

Treat I<filename> as a set of image options, instead of a plain
filename. If this flag is specified, the I<-f> flag should
not be used, instead the 'C<format=>' option should be set.

=item B<-f, --format=>I<fmt>

Force the use of the block driver for format I<fmt> instead of
auto-detecting

=item B<-r, --read-only>

Export the disk as read-only

=item B<-P, --partition=>I<num>

Only expose partition I<num>

=item B<-s, --snapshot>

Use I<filename> as an external snapshot, create a temporary
file with backing_file=I<filename>, redirect the write to
the temporary one

=item B<-l, --load-snapshot=>I<snapshot_param>

Load an internal snapshot inside I<filename> and export it
as an read-only device, I<snapshot_param> format is
'snapshot.id=[ID],snapshot.name=[NAME]' or '[ID_OR_NAME]'

=item B<-n, --nocache>


=item B<--cache=>I<cache>

The cache mode to be used with the file.  See the documentation of
the emulator's C<-drive cache=...> option for allowed values.

=item B<--aio=>I<aio>

Set the asynchronous I/O mode between B<threads> (the default)
and B<native> (Linux only).

=item B<--discard=>I<discard>

Control whether I<discard> (also known as I<trim> or I<unmap>)
requests are ignored or passed to the filesystem.  I<discard> is one of
B<ignore> (or B<off>), B<unmap> (or B<on>).  The default is
B<ignore>.

=item B<--detect-zeroes=>I<detect-zeroes>

Control the automatic conversion of plain zero writes by the OS to
driver-specific optimized zero write commands.  I<detect-zeroes> is one of
B<off>, B<on> or B<unmap>.  B<unmap>
converts a zero write to an unmap operation and can only be used if
I<discard> is set to B<unmap>.  The default is B<off>.

=item B<-c, --connect=>I<dev>

Connect I<filename> to NBD device I<dev>

=item B<-d, --disconnect>

Disconnect the device I<dev>

=item B<-e, --shared=>I<num>

Allow up to I<num> clients to share the device (default B<1>)

=item B<-t, --persistent>

Don't exit on the last connection

=item B<-x, --export-name=>I<name>

Set the NBD volume export name. This switches the server to use
the new style NBD protocol negotiation

=item B<-D, --description=>I<description>

Set the NBD volume export description, as a human-readable
string. Requires the use of B<-x>

=item B<--tls-creds=ID>

Enable mandatory TLS encryption for the server by setting the ID
of the TLS credentials object previously created with the --object
option.

=item B<--fork>

Fork off the server process and exit the parent once the server is running.

=item B<-v, --verbose>

Display extra debugging information

=item B<-h, --help>

Display this help and exit

=item B<-V, --version>

Display version information and exit

=item B<-T, --trace [[enable=]>I<pattern>B<][,events=>I<file>B<][,file=>I<file>B<]>

Specify tracing options.


=over 4


=item B<[enable=]>I<pattern>

Immediately enable events matching I<pattern>.
The file must contain one event name (as listed in the F<trace-events-all>
file) per line; globbing patterns are accepted too.  This option is only
available if QEMU has been compiled with the I<simple>, I<log>
or I<ftrace> tracing backend.  To specify multiple events or patterns,
specify the B<-trace> option multiple times.

Use C<-trace help> to print a list of names of trace points.


=item B<events=>I<file>

Immediately enable events listed in I<file>.
The file must contain one event name (as listed in the F<trace-events-all>
file) per line; globbing patterns are accepted too.  This option is only
available if QEMU has been compiled with the I<simple>, I<log> or
I<ftrace> tracing backend.


=item B<file=>I<file>

Log output traces to I<file>.
This option is only available if QEMU has been compiled with
the I<simple> tracing backend.
